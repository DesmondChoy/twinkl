      "Bio: Mateo Rojas is a 30-year-old gig worker from Guadalajara who coordinates three couriers via a private group chat, juggling shifts across two delivery apps and taking on private event-driving contracts so he can choose which jobs to accept. He spent his savings on a newer motorcycle with branded decals, keeps a notebook of client contacts and fuel loans, and gets deeply unsettled when platform algorithms change pay rates or a high-paying event falls through. He alternates late-night party runs, intercity courier days, and short pop-up businesses—like the taco stall he opened and closed in six weeks—because routine wears on him, and he is now trying to register his micro-fleet as a formal business to set prices and hire riders under his own rules.\n",
