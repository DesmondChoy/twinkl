# LLM-as-Judge Validation Evaluation

## What We're Evaluating

The Judge (LLM-as-Judge) produces training labels for the VIF. This evaluation validates that the Judge's alignment scores are consistent, accurate, and agree with human intuition.

---

## Implementation Status

**Status:** 🟢 Operational

### What's Implemented
- Judge labeling pipeline operational ([`src/judge/consolidate.py`](../../src/judge/consolidate.py))
- Rationale storage in parquet ([`logs/judge_labels/judge_labels.parquet`](../../logs/judge_labels/judge_labels.parquet))
- Data models with rationale support ([`src/models/judge.py`](../../src/models/judge.py))
- Human annotation tool ([`src/annotation_tool/app.py`](../../src/annotation_tool/app.py))
- Cohen's κ and Fleiss' κ calculation ([`src/annotation_tool/agreement_metrics.py`](../../src/annotation_tool/agreement_metrics.py))
- Agreement report export with interpretation guide

### What's Missing
- Automated quality checks (all-zero rate, sparsity, distribution)
- Consistency checks (re-running same entry multiple times)

### Next Steps
1. Review low-agreement values (Universalism, Power, Benevolence) and refine rubrics
2. Add automated quality checks as post-labeling validation
3. Re-annotate subset after rubric improvements to measure κ improvement

## The 3-Point Categorical Rubric

The Judge uses a strict categorical protocol to reduce subjective noise:

| Score | Meaning | Criteria |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **+1** | **Aligned** | Entry actively supports/demonstrates this value through behavior |
| **0** | **Neutral** | Entry is irrelevant to this value OR maintains status quo |
| **-1** | **Misaligned** | Entry actively conflicts with/neglects this value |

**Why categorical?**
- Clear decision boundaries improve consistency
- Avoids arbitrary distinctions (4.5 vs 4.2)
- Maps cleanly to regression targets for the Critic

## Validation Approaches

### 1. Agreement Metrics (Cohen's κ and Fleiss' κ)

We use two complementary kappa metrics to validate Judge labels:

#### Understanding the Two Metrics

```
                    Fleiss' κ
        (Do humans agree with EACH OTHER?)
           ┌──────────┼──────────┐
           │          │          │
      Annotator 1  Annotator 2  Annotator 3
           │          │          │
           └────┬─────┴─────┬────┘
                │           │
             Cohen's κ   Cohen's κ
      (Does THIS human agree with Judge?)
                │           │
                └─────┬─────┘
                      │
                   Judge
```

| Metric | What It Measures | Question It Answers |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Cohen's κ** | Agreement between ONE human and the Judge | "Does this annotator agree with the Judge's labels?" |
| **Fleiss' κ** | Agreement among ALL humans (independent of Judge) | "Do humans agree with each other on what's correct?" |

#### Why Both Metrics Matter

| Scenario | Fleiss' κ | Cohen's κ | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Humans agree with each other AND with Judge | High | High | ✅ Judge is well-calibrated |
| Humans agree with each other BUT NOT with Judge | High | Low | ⚠️ Judge has systematic bias — fix Judge prompt |
| Humans DON'T agree with each other | Low | Varies | ⚠️ Rubric is ambiguous — fix definitions first |

**Critical insight:** If Fleiss' κ is low, humans can't agree on what "correct" means. In this case, low Cohen's κ may reflect rubric ambiguity rather than Judge error. **Always check Fleiss' κ first** — if humans disagree, clarify the rubric before blaming the Judge.

#### Interpretation Scale (Landis & Koch, 1977)

**Target: κ > 0.60** (substantial agreement)

```
κ interpretation:
  < 0.00: Poor (worse than chance)
  0.00-0.20: Slight
  0.21-0.40: Fair
  0.41-0.60: Moderate
  0.61-0.80: Substantial  ← Target
  0.81-1.00: Almost perfect
```

#### Running Agreement Analysis

```bash
# Generate agreement report
shiny run src/annotation_tool/app.py
# → Navigate to Analysis section → Export Agreement Report
```

Reports are saved to `logs/exports/agreement_report_<timestamp>.md`.

### 2. Internal Consistency

Check that the Judge produces consistent scores for similar entries:

- **Same entry, multiple runs**: Run Judge on same entry 3x with temperature=0. All scores should match.
- **Semantically similar entries**: Paraphrased versions of same content should get same scores.

### 3. Calibration Checks

Verify the Judge doesn't systematically over- or under-predict:

- **All-zero check**: Flag entries scored 0 across all dimensions (may indicate overly conservative Judge)
- **Sparsity check**: Flag personas where >80% of entries are all-zero
- **Distribution check**: Scores should roughly match expected base rates per value

---

## Manual Review Protocol

### Sample Selection

From each synthetic data run, review 10-20 entries across different:
- Personas (variety of value profiles)
- Entry types (standalone vs. nudged)
- Tones (positive, negative, neutral)

### Review Questions

For each entry, the human reviewer asks:

1. **Do the non-zero scores match your intuition?**
   - Which values does this entry clearly touch?
   - Did Judge identify them correctly?

2. **Did Judge conflate similar values?**
   - Achievement vs. Power (both about success but different motivations)
   - Benevolence vs. Universalism (both about helping but different scope)
   - Conformity vs. Tradition (both about social norms but different anchors)

3. **Are similar entries getting similar scores?**
   - Compare entries with similar content across personas
   - Flag inconsistencies

### Documentation Template

```markdown
## Entry Review: Persona 3, Entry 5

**Entry**: "Stayed late again to finish the deck. Told myself I'd leave by 6..."

**Judge scores**: Achievement: +1, Hedonism: -1, all others: 0

**Reviewer assessment**:
- [x] Achievement +1: Agree — clearly prioritizing work performance
- [x] Hedonism -1: Agree — sacrificing present comfort for work
- [ ] Benevolence: Should this be -1? Implicitly neglecting relationships
- Notes: Consider adding Benevolence signal to rubric

**Agreement**: 2/2 non-zero scores correct, 1 potential miss
```

## Iteration Loop

If validation reveals quality issues:

### Step 0: Diagnose the Root Cause

**Check Fleiss' κ first** to determine whether the problem is rubric ambiguity or Judge error:

| Fleiss' κ | Cohen's κ | Diagnosis | Action |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Low | Low | Rubric is unclear | → Go to Step 1 (fix rubric) |
| High | Low | Judge has systematic bias | → Go to Step 2 (fix Judge prompt) |
| High | High | No issues | ✅ Done |

### Step 1: Refine Rubrics (if Fleiss' κ is low)

Humans can't agree — the definitions need clarification:

1. **Identify problem values**: Look at per-value Fleiss' κ breakdown
2. **Update `config/schwartz_values.yaml`** with:
   - Clearer distinguishing criteria
   - Concrete examples of edge cases
   - Anti-patterns to avoid
3. **Re-annotate subset**: Have humans re-label 10-20 entries
4. **Check Fleiss' κ improvement**: Repeat until κ > 0.60

### Step 2: Fix Judge (if Cohen's κ is low but Fleiss' κ is high)

Humans agree, but Judge diverges — the Judge prompt needs adjustment:

1. **Identify pattern**: What type of entries does Judge struggle with?
   - Value conflation (Achievement ↔ Power)
   - Tone sensitivity (sarcasm, hedging)
   - Cultural context
2. **Update Judge prompt**: Add constraints or clarifications
3. **Re-run on flagged entries**: Verify improvement before full re-labeling

## Automated Quality Checks

Run these checks automatically on every Judge labeling run:

```python
def validate_judge_output(labels_df):
    issues = []

    # Check 1: All-zero entries
    all_zero = labels_df[labels_df[value_columns].sum(axis=1) == 0]
    if len(all_zero) / len(labels_df) > 0.3:
        issues.append(f"High all-zero rate: {len(all_zero)/len(labels_df):.1%}")

    # Check 2: Per-persona sparsity
    for persona_id in labels_df['persona_id'].unique():
        persona_labels = labels_df[labels_df['persona_id'] == persona_id]
        zero_rate = (persona_labels[value_columns].sum(axis=1) == 0).mean()
        if zero_rate > 0.8:
            issues.append(f"Persona {persona_id} has {zero_rate:.0%} all-zero entries")

    # Check 3: Value distribution
    for col in value_columns:
        dist = labels_df[col].value_counts(normalize=True)
        if dist.get(0, 0) > 0.9:
            issues.append(f"{col} is >90% neutral — may be under-detected")

    return issues
```

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Fleiss' κ (human vs human) | > 0.60 | Humans must agree before evaluating Judge |
| Cohen's κ (human vs Judge) | > 0.60 | Substantial agreement with human intuition |
| Internal consistency | 100% | Same entry → same scores |
| All-zero rate | < 30% | Most entries have signal |
| Per-persona sparsity | < 20% with >80% zeros | Personas should show patterns |

**Evaluation order:** Check Fleiss' κ first. If humans don't agree (κ < 0.60), improve the rubric before evaluating Cohen's κ.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **LLM consistency**: Even with temperature=0, some variance is possible
2. **Human subjectivity**: Inter-rater agreement among humans is also imperfect
3. **Value conflation**: Some values genuinely overlap; perfect separation is impossible

**Mitigations:**
- Use multiple human reviewers, report inter-annotator agreement
- Document expected conflation patterns as acceptable
- Focus on obvious errors, not edge cases

---
