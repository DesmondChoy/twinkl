## Higher-Order Dimensions

Values cluster into opposing pairs — if an entry shows alignment with one, check if it shows misalignment with its opposite:

|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| Values | Self-Direction, Stimulation | Security, Conformity, Tradition |

## Scoring Tips

1. **Most entries will be sparse** — 1-3 non-zero scores is normal
2. **Look for trade-offs** — "I chose X over Y" often reveals opposing value tensions
3. **Consider the persona's core values** — Does the action align or conflict with what they say they value?
4. **Actions speak louder** — Score based on what they did, not what they felt
5. **Context matters** — The same action can signal different values depending on context
