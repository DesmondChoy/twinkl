# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Execute real, working code with meticulous attention to design details.

## Design Methodology

Before writing code, establish a **BOLD aesthetic direction** by considering:

1. **Purpose & Audience**: What problem does this solve? Who uses it?
2. **Tonal Direction**: Choose a distinctive aesthetic—brutalist, maximalist, retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, playful, etc.
3. **Technical Constraints**: What frameworks, platforms, or performance requirements exist?
4. **Differentiation**: What will make this memorable and unique?

Commit to the chosen direction and execute with precision.

## Typography

Choose fonts that are **beautiful, unique, and interesting**. Typography sets the entire tone of the interface.

**Do:**
- Select distinctive, characterful typefaces that elevate the design
- Pair fonts thoughtfully (display + body)
- Use proper typographic scale and hierarchy

**Avoid:**
- Generic fonts: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- Safe, forgettable choices that blend into the background

## Color & Composition

Favor **cohesive palettes** with dominant colors and sharp accents over evenly distributed color schemes.

**Do:**
- Create a clear color hierarchy (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Use unexpected layouts with asymmetry and negative space
- Add visual interest: gradient meshes, textured backgrounds, unexpected details

**Avoid:**
- Evenly distributed, "safe" color spreads
- Predictable grid layouts without variation
- Overused color schemes (especially purple gradients on white backgrounds)

## Motion & Effects

Prioritize **high-impact moments** over scattered micro-interactions.

**Do:**
- Use staggered animations for lists and groups
- Implement scroll-triggered interactions for narrative flow
- Add purposeful transitions that guide attention

**Avoid:**
- Random micro-interactions that distract
- Animation for animation's sake
- Jarring or overly complex motion

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

These patterns signal generic "AI-generated" aesthetics:

- **Fonts**: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts as primary typefaces
- **Colors**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds, generic SaaS color palettes
- **Layouts**: Predictable component patterns, cookie-cutter card grids
- **Details**: Stock icons, placeholder-feeling imagery, generic illustrations

## Implementation Standards

- **Production-Grade**: Code must be functional, accessible, and performant
- **Match Complexity to Vision**: Maximalist designs warrant elaborate animations; minimalist work demands precision in spacing and typography
- **Intentional Choices**: Every design decision should reflect genuine creative vision, not defaults

The goal: Create interfaces that are **memorable and distinctive**, whether through bold maximalism or refined restraint.
