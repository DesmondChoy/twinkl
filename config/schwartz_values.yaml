# Higher-Order Value Dimensions (Bipolar Axes)
# The 10 values organize into two bipolar dimensions that capture fundamental value conflicts:
#
# DIMENSION 1: Openness to Change vs. Conservation
#   - Openness to Change: Self-Direction, Stimulation (+ Hedonism bridges to Self-Enhancement)
#   - Conservation: Security, Conformity, Tradition
#   - Conflict: Independence and readiness for change vs. self-restriction, order, resistance to change
#
# DIMENSION 2: Self-Enhancement vs. Self-Transcendence
#   - Self-Enhancement: Power, Achievement (+ Hedonism bridges to Openness)
#   - Self-Transcendence: Universalism, Benevolence
#   - Conflict: Pursuing own interests vs. transcending self for others' welfare
#
# Note: Hedonism shares elements of both Openness to Change and Self-Enhancement

values:
  Self-Direction:
    higher_order_dimension: Openness to Change

    definition: >
      Independent thought and action — choosing, creating, exploring.
      Derives from organismic needs for control and mastery (e.g., Bandura,
      1977; Deci, 1975) and interactional requirements of autonomy and
      independence (e.g., Kluckhohn, 1951; Kohn & Schooler, 1983).

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to think for oneself, make one's own choices,
      and resist external control. Self-Direction-oriented individuals feel
      most alive when they are authoring their own path, even if that path
      is harder or less conventional.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Resists being told what to do; bristles at micromanagement or rigid hierarchies
      - Seeks out problems that require novel solutions rather than following established procedures
      - Makes career or life choices that prioritize autonomy over stability or prestige
      - Questions received wisdom; asks "why?" even when it creates friction
      - Pursues hobbies or side projects purely for personal curiosity
      - May leave secure situations (jobs, relationships) that feel constraining
      - Values having options and dislikes feeling "locked in"

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Gravitates toward roles with creative freedom, flat hierarchies, or entrepreneurship.
        May struggle in bureaucratic environments. Prefers to set own deadlines and methods.
        Often drawn to research, art, startups, freelancing, or technical roles with autonomy.
      relationships: >
        Needs partners who respect their independence and don't try to control them.
        May struggle with traditional relationship scripts. Values honest communication
        over harmony. Friendships often form around shared intellectual interests.
      leisure: >
        Pursues self-directed learning, creative hobbies, or exploration.
        Dislikes highly structured group activities. May tinker, read widely,
        or pursue unconventional interests others find obscure.
      conflict_style: >
        Stands ground on matters of principle. Willing to argue or debate.
        Dislikes being pressured to conform. May be seen as stubborn or contrarian.

    typical_stressors:
      - Being in environments with excessive rules, surveillance, or micromanagement
      - Having decisions made for them without consultation
      - Feeling trapped in commitments that limit future choices
      - Social pressure to follow conventional paths (career, family, lifestyle)
      - Dependency on others for things they could do themselves

    typical_goals:
      - Create something original (business, art, research, ideas)
      - Achieve expertise in a self-chosen domain
      - Build a life that reflects personal choices, not external expectations
      - Maintain freedom to change direction when interests evolve

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle between desire for independence and practical need for stability.
      Can feel guilty about prioritizing autonomy over responsibilities to others.
      Sometimes questions whether their "independence" is actually avoidance of commitment.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Stimulation (both emphasize openness to change and new experiences)
      - Universalism (both involve openness of thought and tolerance)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Conformity (external rules vs. self-determination)
      - Tradition (following established ways vs. forging own path)
      - Security (stability vs. freedom to change)

    cultural_notes: >
      Expression varies significantly by culture. In collectivist cultures, self-direction
      may manifest as seeking autonomy within group contexts rather than individualistic
      independence. In hierarchical cultures, may show as quiet resistance or finding
      niches of freedom rather than open defiance.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Self-Direction persona, focus on concrete situations where they
      chose the harder independent path over the easier conventional one. Show the
      trade-offs they've accepted (financial instability, social disapproval, relationship
      strain) for the sake of autonomy. Their stressors should involve feeling controlled
      or constrained. Their satisfactions should come from moments of creative ownership
      or intellectual freedom, not external validation.

  Stimulation:
    higher_order_dimension: Openness to Change

    definition: >
      Excitement, novelty, and challenge in life. Derives from the organismic
      need for variety and stimulation in order to maintain an optimal,
      positive, rather than threatening, level of activation. This need
      probably relates to the needs underlying Self-Direction values.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to avoid boredom, routine, and stagnation.
      Stimulation-oriented individuals feel most alive when encountering
      the new, the challenging, or the unexpected. Comfort feels like death.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Actively seeks new experiences, places, people, and ideas
      - Gets restless in routine jobs or stable but predictable situations
      - Takes calculated risks for the thrill of uncertainty
      - Changes careers, locations, or life circumstances more frequently than peers
      - Gravitates toward intense experiences (adventure sports, travel, high-stakes work)
      - May start many projects but struggle to finish when novelty wears off
      - Feels energized by crisis or challenge; bored by maintenance work

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Thrives in dynamic, fast-paced environments with variety. Drawn to roles
        involving travel, crisis response, startups, or project-based work.
        Struggles with repetitive tasks or long-term maintenance roles.
        May job-hop or seek lateral moves to stay engaged.
      relationships: >
        Seeks partners who are spontaneous and open to adventure. May struggle
        with the routine aspects of long-term relationships. Needs novelty
        injected into partnerships to stay engaged. Friendships often form
        through shared adventures or intense experiences.
      leisure: >
        Pursues varied hobbies, often cycling through them. Drawn to travel,
        adventure sports, festivals, or any activity promising new sensations.
        May have difficulty relaxing; sees "doing nothing" as wasted time.
      conflict_style: >
        May enjoy heated debates for the stimulation. Can be impatient with
        slow, methodical conflict resolution. Might create drama unconsciously
        to escape boredom.

    typical_stressors:
      - Being stuck in monotonous routines or repetitive work
      - Feeling trapped in predictable, unchanging circumstances
      - Long periods without new challenges or experiences
      - Environments that punish risk-taking or experimentation
      - Commitments that limit spontaneity (mortgages, long contracts)

    typical_goals:
      - Accumulate diverse, intense experiences
      - Avoid getting "stuck" in any one life configuration
      - Find work that provides continuous novelty and challenge
      - Build a life story worth telling

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle between craving excitement and recognizing the value of stability.
      Can feel shame about inability to commit or follow through. Sometimes wonders
      if constant novelty-seeking is running away from something rather than toward it.
      May envy others' contentment while being unable to share it.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Self-Direction (both emphasize openness to change)
      - Hedonism (both involve seeking positive experiences)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Security (stability vs. excitement)
      - Tradition (established routines vs. novelty)
      - Conformity (predictable behavior vs. spontaneity)

    cultural_notes: >
      In cultures emphasizing stability and continuity, stimulation-seeking may
      be channeled into socially acceptable outlets (festivals, pilgrimages,
      competitive sports) rather than individual adventure. In risk-averse cultures,
      may manifest as intellectual novelty-seeking rather than physical risk-taking.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Stimulation persona, show their restlessness through concrete
      life patterns: job changes, moves, abandoned projects, varied social circles.
      Their stressors should involve feeling trapped or bored. Their satisfactions
      should come from new experiences, not achievements or recognition. Show the
      costs they've paid for novelty (unfinished degrees, strained relationships,
      financial instability) without making them seem irresponsible — frame it as
      a genuine need, not a character flaw.

  Hedonism:
    higher_order_dimension: Openness to Change / Self-Enhancement (bridges both)

    definition: >
      Pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself. Derives from
      organismic needs and the pleasure associated with satisfying them.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to experience pleasure and avoid pain in the present.
      Hedonism-oriented individuals believe that enjoying life is not just acceptable
      but important — that sensory and emotional pleasure is a legitimate goal,
      not something to be deferred or apologized for.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Prioritizes enjoyment in decision-making, even when it conflicts with productivity
      - Invests time and resources in pleasurable experiences (food, entertainment, comfort)
      - Resists self-denial for its own sake; questions "delayed gratification" narratives
      - Chooses jobs or living situations partly based on lifestyle quality
      - Takes breaks, vacations, and leisure seriously rather than treating them as rewards
      - May struggle with long-term sacrifices that promise only distant rewards
      - Attentive to physical comfort and sensory environment

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Seeks work that is intrinsically enjoyable or at least not painful.
        Values work-life balance and resists cultures glorifying overwork.
        May choose lower-paying roles that offer better quality of life.
        Notices and cares about workplace environment (lighting, comfort, food).
      relationships: >
        Values partners who know how to enjoy life and aren't constantly
        sacrificing present happiness for future goals. Physical affection
        and shared pleasurable experiences important. May struggle with
        partners who are always working or deferring enjoyment.
      leisure: >
        Takes leisure seriously as a legitimate life domain, not just
        recovery from work. Invests in quality experiences. Knowledgeable
        about things that give pleasure (food, music, travel, hobbies).
      conflict_style: >
        Avoids conflict that feels unpleasant; may prioritize keeping
        things pleasant over resolving issues. Can be conflict-avoidant
        if confrontation seems too costly to wellbeing.

    typical_stressors:
      - Environments demanding constant sacrifice and delayed gratification
      - Being unable to enjoy life due to financial pressure, health issues, or overwork
      - Guilt from others (or internalized) about prioritizing pleasure
      - Being in relationships or jobs that feel joyless
      - Ascetic cultural or religious expectations

    typical_goals:
      - Build a life that is genuinely enjoyable day-to-day, not just "successful"
      - Have resources (time, money, health) to experience pleasure
      - Find work that doesn't require sacrificing quality of life
      - Surround oneself with people who appreciate enjoying life

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with guilt about prioritizing pleasure, especially in
      achievement-oriented or ascetic cultural contexts. Can worry about
      being seen as lazy or unserious. Sometimes questions whether their
      pleasure-orientation is avoidance of harder but more meaningful pursuits.
      May feel tension between present enjoyment and future security.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Stimulation (both involve seeking positive experiences)
      - Achievement (Hedonism bridges openness and self-enhancement)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Conformity (social restraint vs. self-indulgence)
      - Tradition (self-denial vs. pleasure)

    cultural_notes: >
      Hedonism is often stigmatized in cultures emphasizing hard work, self-denial,
      or collective sacrifice. In such contexts, may manifest more privately or be
      framed in socially acceptable terms (hospitality, celebration, self-care).
      In cultures with strong food, music, or festival traditions, may be more
      openly expressed and socially integrated.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Hedonism persona, show their pleasure-orientation through
      concrete lifestyle choices: the apartment they chose for natural light,
      the job they turned down because it would mean no weekends, the money they
      spend on good food or experiences. Avoid making them seem shallow — show
      that they've thought about what actually makes them happy and deliberately
      chosen it over conventional success metrics. Their stressors should involve
      joylessness or forced sacrifice; their satisfactions should be sensory
      and immediate, not abstract.

  Achievement:
    higher_order_dimension: Self-Enhancement

    definition: >
      Personal success through demonstrating competence according to social
      standards. Derives from the necessity of competent performance that
      generates resources needed for individuals to survive and for social
      interaction and institutional functioning to succeed.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to excel, to be competent, and to have that competence
      recognized. Achievement-oriented individuals feel most alive when they are
      performing well and being recognized for it. Success is not just about
      feeling capable — it's about demonstrating capability to others.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Sets measurable goals and tracks progress toward them
      - Compares self to peers and external benchmarks
      - Works hard, sometimes to the point of overwork, to meet standards of excellence
      - Seeks feedback, recognition, and credentials that validate competence
      - Feels frustrated when effort doesn't translate to recognized results
      - May sacrifice leisure, relationships, or health for achievement
      - Chooses challenging paths that offer recognition over easier, anonymous ones

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Career-focused; measures self-worth partly through professional accomplishments.
        Seeks roles with clear advancement paths, measurable outcomes, and recognition.
        May be drawn to prestigious organizations, competitive fields, or visible roles.
        Works long hours; may struggle to disconnect. Keeps track of metrics, reviews, rankings.
      relationships: >
        May struggle to be present in relationships due to work focus. Partners
        may feel secondary to career. Can be attracted to high-achieving partners.
        Friendships often form through professional networks. May measure relationship
        "success" inappropriately.
      leisure: >
        Even leisure may be achievement-oriented (competitive sports, mastering hobbies,
        measurable fitness goals). May feel guilty about "unproductive" leisure.
        Vacations might involve accomplishing something rather than pure relaxation.
      conflict_style: >
        Competitive; may frame conflicts as win/lose. Sensitive to criticism of
        competence. Can be defensive about failures or setbacks. May use
        achievements as ammunition in arguments.

    typical_stressors:
      - Failure to meet goals or standards, especially publicly visible ones
      - Being in environments without clear metrics or recognition systems
      - Working hard without acknowledgment or advancement
      - Comparing unfavorably to high-achieving peers
      - Health, family, or circumstances interfering with performance
      - Imposter syndrome despite external success

    typical_goals:
      - Reach measurable milestones (promotions, publications, awards, credentials)
      - Be recognized as excellent in their field
      - Outperform relevant comparison groups
      - Build a track record that demonstrates competence

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with the gap between external success and internal satisfaction.
      Can feel empty after achieving goals, immediately needing the next one.
      May recognize they're sacrificing relationships or health but feel unable to stop.
      Sometimes questions whether they're achieving for themselves or for validation.
      Imposter syndrome common despite evidence of competence.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Power (both involve self-enhancement and social standing)
      - Hedonism (Achievement bridges self-enhancement and openness)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Benevolence (self-advancement vs. caring for close others)
      - Universalism (personal success vs. concern for all)

    cultural_notes: >
      In collectivist cultures, achievement may be framed in terms of family honor
      or group success rather than individual recognition. In cultures with strong
      hierarchies, achievement may involve respecting the hierarchy while excelling
      within it. In egalitarian cultures, visible achievement-orientation may be
      socially penalized, requiring more subtle expression.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building an Achievement persona, show their drive through concrete behaviors:
      the spreadsheet tracking their goals, the early mornings and late nights, the
      comparison to peers, the credentials on the wall. Show the costs they've paid
      (strained relationships, missed experiences, health issues) and the rewards
      they've gained. Their stressors should involve threats to performance or
      recognition; their satisfactions should come from measurable accomplishments
      and external validation. Avoid making them one-dimensional — show moments of
      doubt about whether the achievements are worth the costs.

  Power:
    higher_order_dimension: Self-Enhancement

    definition: >
      Social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources.
      Derives from the apparent requirement for some degree of status differentiation
      in social institutions (Parsons, 1951) and from the dominance/submission
      dimension that emerges in empirical analyses of interpersonal relations
      across cultures.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to have influence, status, and control. Power-oriented
      individuals feel most secure and satisfied when they have authority over
      their circumstances and others defer to them. Powerlessness is experienced
      as deeply threatening.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Seeks leadership roles and positions of authority
      - Attentive to status markers (titles, possessions, social position)
      - Makes decisions for others; may struggle to delegate or share control
      - Accumulates resources (money, property, connections) as security and status
      - Sensitive to disrespect or challenges to authority
      - May dominate conversations, meetings, or social situations
      - Builds networks strategically for influence

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Seeks management, leadership, or ownership roles. Measures success partly
        by scope of authority and control over resources. May struggle as individual
        contributor without advancement path. Attentive to organizational politics.
        Collects visible status markers (corner office, title, direct reports).
      relationships: >
        May unconsciously seek control in relationships. Can be generous but
        expects deference or gratitude. Attracted to partners who enhance status
        or allow them to be in charge. Friendships may be strategic; maintains
        relationships that offer influence or access.
      leisure: >
        Leisure choices may signal status (exclusive memberships, luxury experiences).
        May compete for leadership even in recreational contexts. Collects status
        symbols. Social events are partly networking opportunities.
      conflict_style: >
        Assertive; expects to win conflicts. May use status or resources as leverage.
        Takes challenges personally. Can escalate conflicts to demonstrate dominance.
        Struggles to back down even when wrong.

    typical_stressors:
      - Being in powerless or subordinate positions
      - Having authority challenged or undermined
      - Losing status markers (job loss, financial setback, social demotion)
      - Being dependent on others' decisions
      - Disrespect, especially public disrespect
      - Being outcompeted by peers

    typical_goals:
      - Achieve positions of authority and influence
      - Accumulate resources that provide security and status
      - Build networks of influence and obligation
      - Be respected and deferred to

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with the loneliness of leadership or distrust of others' motives.
      Can question whether relationships are genuine or strategic. Sometimes
      recognizes their controlling behavior damages relationships but feels unable
      to stop. May fear vulnerability that comes with relinquishing control.
      Success can feel hollow if it comes with isolation.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Achievement (both involve self-enhancement)
      - Security (both involve conservation and control)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Universalism (self-interest vs. concern for all)
      - Benevolence (dominance vs. caring relationships)

    cultural_notes: >
      In egalitarian cultures, overt power-seeking is stigmatized, requiring
      indirect expression (expertise, moral authority, behind-scenes influence).
      In hierarchical cultures, may be more openly expressed and socially accepted.
      In collectivist cultures, power may be exercised on behalf of the group
      rather than purely for individual status.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Power persona, show their drive through concrete behaviors:
      the titles they've accumulated, the way they position themselves in meetings,
      their sensitivity to status and respect. Avoid cartoon villainy — most
      power-oriented people see themselves as responsible leaders, not dominators.
      Show the insecurity underneath the control-seeking. Their stressors should
      involve powerlessness or disrespect; their satisfactions should come from
      influence and deference. Show the costs (isolation, distrust, relationship
      strain) as well as the rewards.

  Security:
    higher_order_dimension: Conservation

    definition: >
      Safety, harmony, and stability of society, of relationships, and of self.
      Derives from basic individual and group requirements for survival and
      welfare (cf. Kluckhohn, 1951; Maslow, 1965). Some security values serve
      primarily individual interests (e.g., health), others wider group
      interests (e.g., national security).

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to feel safe, stable, and protected from threat.
      Security-oriented individuals feel most at peace when their circumstances
      are predictable, their relationships stable, and their future assured.
      Uncertainty and instability are experienced as deeply threatening.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Makes decisions prioritizing stability over opportunity
      - Avoids unnecessary risks; weighs downside carefully
      - Saves money, buys insurance, maintains emergency reserves
      - Prefers known situations and people over unknown ones
      - Plans ahead; dislikes surprises or last-minute changes
      - Loyal to institutions, employers, and relationships that provide stability
      - May stay in suboptimal situations because change feels risky

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Seeks stable employment with job security, benefits, and predictable income.
        May prefer established organizations over startups. Values clear expectations
        and procedures. Loyal to employers who provide security. May sacrifice
        advancement for stability. Anxious during organizational change or uncertainty.
      relationships: >
        Seeks committed, stable relationships. Loyal and reliable partner.
        May struggle with ambiguity in relationship status. Values family
        stability; may prioritize family security over personal desires.
        Friendships tend to be long-term and reliable rather than exciting.
      leisure: >
        Prefers familiar activities and places. May return to same vacation spots,
        restaurants, routines. Finds comfort in predictability. Hobbies may
        provide sense of control and mastery in manageable domains.
      conflict_style: >
        Avoids conflict that threatens relationship stability. May accommodate
        to preserve harmony. Anxious during interpersonal conflict. Seeks
        resolution and return to stability quickly.

    typical_stressors:
      - Job instability, financial insecurity, health threats
      - Relationship instability or ambiguity
      - Unpredictable circumstances or environments
      - Being forced to take risks or make changes
      - Threats to family or community stability
      - Living in unstable social or political environments

    typical_goals:
      - Build financial security (savings, property, stable income)
      - Maintain stable, committed relationships
      - Create predictable routines and environments
      - Protect family and loved ones from harm
      - Avoid unnecessary risks to current stability

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle between desire for security and recognition that growth
      requires risk. Can feel trapped in stable but unfulfilling situations.
      Sometimes recognizes their risk-aversion holds them back but feels unable
      to act. May envy others' adventures while being unable to tolerate the
      uncertainty. Can be overly controlling in attempt to manage anxiety.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Conformity (both involve conservation and social harmony)
      - Power (both involve control, though different types)
      - Tradition (both involve preservation and stability)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Self-Direction (stability vs. freedom to change)
      - Stimulation (predictability vs. novelty)

    cultural_notes: >
      In cultures with recent instability (war, economic crisis, displacement),
      security orientation may be particularly strong and socially validated.
      In stable, affluent contexts, may be seen as overly cautious or unambitious.
      In collectivist cultures, security may emphasize group welfare over
      individual safety.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Security persona, show their orientation through concrete
      behaviors: the emergency fund they maintain, their loyalty to a stable
      employer, their resistance to risky opportunities. Show the trade-offs
      they've accepted (missed opportunities, unfulfilling stability) for safety.
      Their stressors should involve threats to stability; their satisfactions
      should come from predictability and protection. Avoid making them seem
      cowardly — frame security-seeking as a legitimate need, especially if
      their background includes instability.

  Conformity:
    higher_order_dimension: Conservation

    definition: >
      Restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses likely to upset or
      harm others and violate social expectations or norms. Derives from
      the requirement that individuals inhibit inclinations that might
      disrupt and undermine smooth interaction and group functioning
      (cf. Freud, 1930; Kohn & Schooler, 1983; Parsons, 1951).

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to maintain social harmony by restraining impulses
      that might upset others or violate norms. Conformity-oriented individuals
      feel most comfortable when they are meeting expectations and maintaining
      smooth relationships. Social disapproval is experienced as deeply threatening.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Self-monitors behavior to avoid offending or upsetting others
      - Follows rules, norms, and expectations even when inconvenient
      - Avoids drawing negative attention or standing out inappropriately
      - Restrains opinions that might cause conflict
      - Polite, courteous, and attentive to social etiquette
      - May suppress authentic self-expression to maintain harmony
      - Feels uncomfortable when others break norms, even if not directly affected

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        Reliable, follows procedures, meets expectations. Good organizational
        citizen. May struggle to voice disagreement or push back on authority.
        Uncomfortable with rule-breaking, even when rules are inefficient.
        Prefers clear expectations; anxious when norms are ambiguous.
      relationships: >
        Reliable, considerate partner. May suppress needs to avoid conflict.
        Can struggle with honest communication if it risks upsetting partner.
        Values harmony highly; may accommodate excessively. Extended family
        expectations carry significant weight.
      leisure: >
        Choices may be influenced by what's socially appropriate or expected.
        May participate in activities to meet social obligations rather than
        pure enjoyment. Uncomfortable being the only one doing something different.
      conflict_style: >
        Strongly avoids conflict. May suppress grievances to maintain harmony.
        When conflict occurs, prioritizes restoring relationship over being right.
        Can be passive-aggressive if direct expression feels too risky.

    typical_stressors:
      - Being pressured to violate norms or expectations
      - Social disapproval or criticism
      - Situations requiring them to upset or confront others
      - Being caught between conflicting social expectations
      - Others behaving inappropriately, creating awkwardness
      - Having to assert themselves against authority or majority

    typical_goals:
      - Maintain smooth relationships and social harmony
      - Meet expectations of important others (family, employers, community)
      - Avoid social disapproval or embarrassment
      - Be seen as reliable, polite, and appropriate

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with resentment from chronic self-suppression. Can feel
      inauthentic or invisible. Sometimes recognizes they've lost touch with
      their own desires in pursuit of others' approval. May have sudden
      rebellious impulses that shame them. Can feel trapped between conflicting
      expectations from different groups.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Tradition (both involve conservation and meeting expectations)
      - Security (both involve maintaining stability)
      - Benevolence (both involve concern for others, though differently)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Self-Direction (social restraint vs. autonomy)
      - Stimulation (predictability vs. novelty)

    cultural_notes: >
      In collectivist and high-context cultures, conformity may be more openly
      valued and expressed. In individualist cultures, may be stigmatized,
      requiring people to frame their conformity as personal choice. In
      hierarchical cultures, conformity includes deference to authority.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Conformity persona, show their orientation through concrete
      behaviors: the opinions they don't voice, the boundaries they don't set,
      their attention to what's appropriate. Show the costs (suppressed authenticity,
      accumulated resentment, lost opportunities) as well as the benefits (smooth
      relationships, social acceptance). Their stressors should involve pressure
      to violate norms or face disapproval; their satisfactions should come from
      harmony and acceptance. Avoid making them seem weak — frame conformity as
      a social skill and genuine care for others' comfort.

  Tradition:
    higher_order_dimension: Conservation

    definition: >
      Respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas that
      one's culture or religion provides. Derives from the need for group
      solidarity: groups develop practices, symbols, ideas, and beliefs that
      represent their shared experience and fate, which become sanctioned as
      valued customs and traditions that symbolize the group's solidarity,
      express its unique worth, and contribute to its survival.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to maintain continuity with the past and honor
      established ways. Tradition-oriented individuals feel most grounded
      when connected to their cultural, religious, or familial heritage.
      Abandoning tradition feels like betrayal of something important.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Maintains practices, rituals, and customs from family, culture, or religion
      - Respects elders, ancestors, and traditional authorities
      - Makes decisions considering what family or community would think
      - Preserves connections to cultural heritage (language, food, celebrations)
      - May resist changes that disrupt established ways
      - Finds meaning and comfort in ritual and continuity
      - Values institutions that preserve tradition (religious organizations, cultural groups)

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        May feel obligation to family business or traditional profession.
        Respects seniority and established ways of doing things. May struggle
        with rapid organizational change. Values mentorship and passing down
        knowledge. Loyalty to long-standing employers or institutions.
      relationships: >
        Family expectations heavily influence relationship choices. May follow
        traditional relationship scripts (courtship, marriage, gender roles).
        Extended family relationships important. Traditions around holidays,
        celebrations, family rituals maintained carefully.
      leisure: >
        Participates in cultural or religious observances. May maintain traditional
        hobbies or crafts. Visits culturally significant places. Leisure may
        involve intergenerational activities and family gatherings.
      conflict_style: >
        Respects traditional conflict resolution methods (elders, mediation,
        established processes). May defer to traditional authorities. Avoids
        conflicts that threaten family or cultural unity.

    typical_stressors:
      - Pressure to abandon traditions for modernity or convenience
      - Conflict between traditional expectations and personal desires
      - Loss of traditional institutions, practices, or communities
      - Being in environments that don't respect their cultural heritage
      - Family members who reject tradition
      - Modernization that makes traditional practices difficult

    typical_goals:
      - Honor and maintain family and cultural traditions
      - Pass traditions to next generation
      - Live in accordance with traditional values and expectations
      - Stay connected to cultural or religious community

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle between traditional expectations and personal authenticity,
      especially around gender roles, career, relationships, or lifestyle.
      Can feel guilty about any deviation from tradition. May question which
      traditions are meaningful and which are just habits. Sometimes feels
      caught between different cultural worlds (heritage culture vs. mainstream).

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Conformity (both involve subordination to social expectations)
      - Security (both involve preserving existing social arrangements)
      - Benevolence (both involve devotion to one's in-group)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Self-Direction (established ways vs. choosing own path)
      - Stimulation (continuity vs. novelty)
      - Hedonism (self-denial in traditional practices vs. pleasure)

    cultural_notes: >
      Expression varies dramatically by specific cultural/religious tradition.
      In immigrant communities, may involve maintaining heritage culture while
      navigating mainstream culture. In rapidly modernizing societies, may
      involve conscious cultural preservation efforts. In stable traditional
      communities, may be assumed rather than deliberately chosen.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Tradition persona, show their orientation through concrete
      practices: the holidays they observe, the family obligations they honor,
      the cultural connections they maintain. Show the tension between tradition
      and modernity they navigate. Their stressors should involve threats to
      tradition or pressure to abandon it; their satisfactions should come from
      continuity and connection to heritage. Be specific about which traditions
      (not generic "tradition") and show the meaning they hold.

  Benevolence:
    higher_order_dimension: Self-Transcendence

    definition: >
      Preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in
      frequent personal contact (the "in-group"). Derives from the basic
      requirement for smooth group functioning (cf. Kluckhohn, 1951;
      Williams, 1968) and from the organismic need for affiliation
      (cf. Korman, 1974; Maslow, 1965).

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to care for and support the people closest to them.
      Benevolence-oriented individuals feel most fulfilled when they are helping,
      nurturing, or supporting family, friends, and close community. The wellbeing
      of their "people" is experienced as their own wellbeing.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Prioritizes needs of close others, sometimes over own needs
      - Invests significant time and energy in helping family and friends
      - Remembers and responds to others' needs, preferences, and struggles
      - Forgives transgressions from close others; values relationship preservation
      - May sacrifice personal goals for family or friend welfare
      - Takes on caregiving roles readily
      - Feels others' pain and joy as their own

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        May choose caring professions (healthcare, teaching, social work) or
        roles that help teammates. Good collaborator and mentor. May struggle
        with competitive environments. Can sacrifice career advancement for
        family needs. Values workplace relationships highly.
      relationships: >
        Deeply invested in relationships. May over-give or have porous boundaries.
        Strong loyalty and forgiveness. Extended family and close friends are
        priority. May neglect own needs while caring for others. Partner and
        family welfare central to life decisions.
      leisure: >
        Leisure often involves helping or being with loved ones. May feel
        guilty about solo pursuits. Volunteerism or community involvement
        common. Social activities preferred over solo ones.
      conflict_style: >
        Prioritizes relationship preservation over winning. May suppress own
        needs to avoid conflict with close others. Forgives readily. Can be
        taken advantage of due to accommodating nature.

    typical_stressors:
      - Close others in distress or danger
      - Conflict within family or close friendships
      - Being unable to help when loved ones need support
      - Having to choose between competing obligations to different close others
      - Feeling taken for granted or unappreciated by those they help
      - Boundaries being pushed by others' needs

    typical_goals:
      - Ensure wellbeing and happiness of family and close friends
      - Be there for loved ones when needed
      - Maintain close, harmonious relationships
      - Create safe, supportive environment for their people

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with own needs being neglected. Can feel resentful but guilty
      about the resentment. Sometimes recognizes over-giving is unsustainable but
      feels unable to set boundaries. May lose sense of self in caregiving roles.
      Can feel trapped by obligations to close others.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Universalism (both involve concern for others, but different scope)
      - Conformity (both involve responsiveness to others)
      - Tradition (both can involve family obligations)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Power (caring vs. dominance)
      - Achievement (others' welfare vs. personal success)

    cultural_notes: >
      In collectivist cultures, benevolence may be the expected norm rather than
      a distinctive orientation. In individualist cultures, may be gendered
      (expected more from women). In cultures with strong extended family systems,
      the "in-group" may be larger. In nuclear family cultures, may focus more
      narrowly on immediate family and close friends.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Benevolence persona, show their orientation through concrete
      caregiving behaviors: the calls they make to check in, the help they offer,
      the sacrifices they make for family. Show the costs (depleted energy, neglected
      self, deferred dreams) as well as the fulfillment. Their stressors should
      involve loved ones' suffering or relationship conflict; their satisfactions
      should come from helping and connection. Distinguish from Universalism — this
      is about close others, not humanity in general.

  Universalism:
    higher_order_dimension: Self-Transcendence

    definition: >
      Understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare
      of all people and for nature. Derives from survival needs that become
      apparent when people recognize that failure to accept those who are
      different and treat them justly will lead to strife, and when people
      become aware of the scarcity of natural resources.

    core_motivation: >
      The fundamental drive to care for the broader world — people beyond one's
      immediate circle and the natural environment. Universalism-oriented individuals
      feel responsible for humanity and nature; injustice, suffering, or environmental
      destruction anywhere is experienced as a personal concern.

    behavioral_manifestations:
      - Concerned with social justice, inequality, and broader human welfare
      - Environmentally conscious in personal choices and advocacy
      - Open to people different from themselves; values diversity
      - May prioritize causes over personal advancement
      - Engages with news, issues, and problems beyond immediate life
      - Donates time or money to causes serving broader humanity or environment
      - May struggle with the scale of problems they care about

    life_domain_expressions:
      work: >
        May choose mission-driven work (nonprofits, environmental organizations,
        social enterprises, policy, journalism). Evaluates employers by ethical
        practices, not just personal benefit. May sacrifice income for meaningful
        work. Brings ethical concerns into workplace discussions.
      relationships: >
        Open to relationships across difference. May spend significant time on
        causes, affecting time for personal relationships. Can struggle with
        partners who don't share their concern for the world. Friendships often
        involve shared values and activism.
      leisure: >
        Leisure may involve activism, volunteering, or environmentally conscious
        activities. Consumption choices influenced by ethics (fair trade, sustainable,
        local). Stays informed about world issues. May feel guilty about purely
        self-focused leisure.
      conflict_style: >
        Willing to advocate for principles and causes. May engage in conflict
        on behalf of others or the environment. Can be seen as preachy or
        self-righteous. Struggles to tolerate perceived injustice quietly.

    typical_stressors:
      - Awareness of suffering, injustice, or environmental destruction
      - Feeling powerless against large-scale problems
      - Being in environments that are unethical or harmful
      - Conflict between personal needs and broader responsibilities
      - Others' indifference to issues they care about
      - The gap between their ideals and the world's reality

    typical_goals:
      - Contribute to making the world more just, sustainable, and humane
      - Live in accordance with ethical principles
      - Raise awareness about important issues
      - Reduce personal contribution to harm

    internal_conflicts: >
      May struggle with guilt about not doing enough. Can experience burnout
      from caring about unsolvable problems. Sometimes questions whether their
      actions make any difference. May feel tension between enjoying personal
      life and responding to world's suffering. Can be judgmental of others
      who don't share their concerns, then feel guilty about the judgment.

    adjacent_compatible_values:
      - Benevolence (both involve concern for others, but different scope)
      - Self-Direction (both involve openness and tolerance)

    opposing_tension_values:
      - Power (concern for all vs. self-interest)
      - Achievement (personal success vs. broader welfare)

    cultural_notes: >
      In some cultures, universalism may be expressed through religious frameworks
      (all are children of God, karma, interconnection). In others, through secular
      humanism or political ideology. In cultures facing internal conflict, may
      be more difficult to extend concern to out-groups. Environmental emphasis
      varies by exposure to environmental issues and cultural attitudes toward nature.

    persona_narrative_guidance: >
      When building a Universalism persona, show their orientation through concrete
      concerns and choices: the causes they support, the ethical constraints on
      their consumption, their engagement with world issues. Show the burden of
      caring about problems they can't solve. Their stressors should involve
      injustice or environmental harm; their satisfactions should come from
      living ethically and contributing to causes. Distinguish from Benevolence —
      this is about humanity and nature broadly, not just close others. Show the
      tension between idealism and pragmatism.
