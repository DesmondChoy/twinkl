      model.hidden_dim:
        from: 64
        to: 128
  rationale: Continued capacity exploration on nomic-embed-256d encoder, increasing
    hidden_dim from 64 to 128. Tests whether further capacity gains improve metrics
    or trigger overfitting at param/sample ratio ~56.

observations: SoftOrdinal QWK comparable at 0.333 (vs 0.329 at hd=64) — additional
  capacity does not help. Calibration improved to 0.770 (from 0.761), the best
  among run_008 losses. Hedonism was exceptional (QWK 0.588, Spearman 0.597).
  Achievement strong at 0.535. Conformity calibration reached 0.829, the highest
  for that dimension across all runs. Training gap increased to 0.388 (from 0.133),
  confirming SoftOrdinal's soft-label formulation amplifies overfitting at higher
  capacity. Power remained near-zero (0.082).
