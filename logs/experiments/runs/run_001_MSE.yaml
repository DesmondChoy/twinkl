  rationale: Baseline run establishing initial metrics for MiniLM-384d encoder with
    large hidden_dim (256). First experiment round to compare all five loss functions
    under the same encoder/capacity configuration.

observations: MSE produces the most decisive predictions (hedging 37.3%) with best
  minority recall (0.428) but at severe cost — MAE 0.450 is nearly double the ordinal
  losses, and calibration is catastrophically negative (-0.218) with only 1/10 positive
  dimensions. Four dimensions have calibration below -0.4 (stimulation, achievement,
  power, tradition), making predictions dangerously over-confident. Training gap (0.405)
  also indicates substantial overfitting. MSE was dropped in subsequent runs.
