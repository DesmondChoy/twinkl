## Interpretation Guide

**Kappa (κ) measures agreement beyond chance** (Landis & Koch, 1977):

| κ Range | Interpretation | Meaning |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| < 0.00 | Poor | Agreement worse than random chance |
| 0.00–0.20 | Slight | Minimal agreement |
| 0.21–0.40 | Fair | Some agreement, but inconsistent |
| 0.41–0.60 | Moderate | Reasonable agreement |
| 0.61–0.80 | Substantial | Strong agreement ← **Target** |
| 0.81–1.00 | Almost Perfect | Near-complete agreement |

**Cohen's κ**: Measures agreement between ONE human annotator and the Judge.

**Fleiss' κ**: Measures agreement among ALL human annotators (do humans agree with each other?).
