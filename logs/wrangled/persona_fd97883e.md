## Profile
- **Persona ID:** fd97883e
- **Name:** Mei-Lin Chen
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Achievement, Security
- **Bio:** Mei-Lin left her position as a financial analyst six years ago when her first child was born, a decision she still measures herself against. Now managing a household in suburban Singapore with two children (ages 6 and 3), she runs the home with the same precision she once applied to quarterly reports, tracking developmental milestones and educational benchmarks obsessively. Her husband's stable government job provides the predictability she craves, but she often lies awake calculating whether their savings buffer is sufficient for every conceivable emergency.

Jia Hui came home with her spelling test today. 18 out of 20. The teacher wrote "Good effort!" at the top with a smiley face. I smiled and told her I was proud, put it on the fridge with a magnet.

But my mother-in-law saw it during dinner and said "Wah, only 18? Last time your husband always got full marks." I watched Jia Hui's face fall and I wanted to say something, anything, but I just changed the subject to the soup being too salty. I know she means well. I know comparison is how she shows she cares. Still scrubbing the wok now and can't stop thinking about it.

Registered Jia Hui for the enrichment center near the MRT. Three sessions a week, $800 a month. Told myself it's an investment, not an expense, but I keep opening the banking app to look at the balance.

Ming keeps having nightmares. Third time this week I've been up at 2am holding him while he cries about "the shadow monster." Wei Hong sleeps through it all. I don't wake him anymore because he has that big presentation tomorrow, the one that might lead to the department head promotion.

I'm running on four hours of sleep and I still have to get both kids ready, meal prep for the week, and somehow fit in that phonics practice with Jia Hui because the enrichment teacher said she's "a bit behind the others." Behind. She's six. My hands are shaking from the coffee and I haven't even brushed my teeth yet.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-16

Parent-teacher conference today. Teacher said Jia Hui is "well-adjusted" and "a pleasure to have in class." Also said her math is strong but reading comprehension needs work. Suggested we read together more at home.

I nodded and wrote it all down in my notebook, the one I keep for tracking both kids' progress. Wei Hong couldn't come because of work, so I'll brief him tonight. Already ordered three new comprehension workbooks from Popular. Express delivery.

On the way home I saw one of the other mothers from the enrichment center. Her daughter is in Primary 2 already doing Primary 4 assessment books. She asked which tuition center we use for math and I lied and said we were still "exploring options." Didn't want to admit we only do the one enrichment class because I'm paranoid about the budget.

We have enough. I know we have enough. Wei Hong's bonus came in last month, we maxed out the CPF contributions, the emergency fund has eight months of expenses now. But I keep thinking about what happens if he loses his job, or if one of the kids needs medical treatment not covered by insurance, or if prices keep going up and suddenly eight months becomes four.

My mother used to say "save for nine winters" and I always thought it was superstition. Now I understand. You never know which winter will be the long one.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-26

Christmas gathering at my sister's place yesterday. All the cousins comparing which schools their kids got into, which scholarships they're aiming for. Jia Hui sat in the corner playing with her cousin's old toys while the adults talked about tuition fees and percentile rankings. I should have pulled her into the conversation. I should have let her be a child.

Wei Hong asked if we really need the third workbook. Said Jia Hui looked tired this week. I told him I'm the one here every day, I see what she needs. He dropped it. Maybe I shouldn't have snapped.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-03

New year. Everyone posting their resolutions online. "More quality time with family." "Less screen time." "Be present." I used to make those lists too. Detailed ones, with deadlines and KPIs like I was still writing performance reviews.

This morning Jia Hui asked if we could just play today. No workbooks, no practice. Just play. And I said yes. We built a blanket fort and read picture books inside it while Ming napped. She laughed so hard at the silly voices I made for the characters. For two hours I forgot about enrichment schedules and comprehension scores and whether we're saving enough.

Then tonight, putting her to bed, she said "Mama, today was the best day." And I don't know why but I started crying after I closed her door. Is this what I've been missing? Is this what she needed all along? I keep score so carefully but I'm not sure I'm measuring the right things anymore.
