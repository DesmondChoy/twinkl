## Entry 0 - 2025-11-05

So I just got back from the department mixer and my head is swimming with possibilities. Priya from the neuroscience lab was talking about this crazy project they're starting with VR and neural mapping and I kept thinking why am I not doing THAT. My current project is fine, it's perfectly fine, it's just—sequencing data, more sequencing data, writing scripts to process sequencing data. Rinse and repeat for the next three years apparently.

Then again I did just switch labs six months ago so maybe I should stay put? But Dr. Mehta's stuff is so much more interesting. He was at the mixer too and mentioned they're doing fieldwork in Costa Rica next semester. COSTA RICA. I haven't been anywhere since Vietnam and my feet are literally itching.

I talked to Aditya after and he thinks I'm insane. "Bro you can't switch labs again, what will your committee think?" He's probably right. He's always right and it's annoying. But also he's been in the same lab since day one doing the same protein folding stuff and seems perfectly happy which I genuinely don't understand. How does someone just... do one thing?

Anyway the mixer had good samosas at least. Small wins.

**Nudge:** "What's the Costa Rica project actually about?"

**Response:** Honestly? I don't even fully know. Something about tracking disease vectors in rainforest ecosystems. I think what got me was just... the image of it. Being in a rainforest with equipment, collecting real samples, not just sitting in front of a terminal. I've been in climate-controlled rooms for two years straight. Maybe it's not about the science at all, maybe I just need to feel like I'm actually DOING something with my body, not just my brain. That's probably a terrible reason to uproot everything again.

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-06

I can't believe my parents called during lab meeting. Like yes I know I told them to call anytime but I didn't mean DURING LAB MEETING. Had to decline and now I have three missed calls and a WhatsApp message that just says "call us urgent" which probably means they found out about the Vietnam credit card bill I thought I'd hidden.

But that's not even the real issue. The real issue is that Dr. Sharma asked me about my thesis timeline today and I had nothing to say. Literally nothing. I don't know what my thesis IS yet. Everyone else seems to have these perfectly formed research questions and I'm over here like "I don't know, something with genomics maybe? Can I take a gap year?" Obviously I didn't say that last part out loud.

The worst part is I know I'm smart enough to do this. I know I could focus if I wanted to. But I sit down to work on my analysis and within twenty minutes I'm looking at flights to New Zealand or researching pottery classes or wondering if I should learn to surf. My brain just doesn't want to stay in one place. Sometimes I feel like there's something wrong with me, like everyone else got a stability gene I missed.

Amma's going to be so disappointed when she finds out I haven't figured anything out. She keeps telling everyone back home that her son is getting a PhD in America. What she doesn't say is that her son might not actually finish it.

**Nudge:** "That stability gene thing—do you actually believe that?"

**Response:** I don't know. Sometimes. Like when I watch Aditya work on the same problem for eight hours straight and I can barely sit still for forty-five minutes without needing to get up, get chai, check my phone, look out the window. It makes me feel broken. But then I also think—maybe I'm just not doing the right thing? Like maybe if I found the RIGHT project I'd be obsessed with it? I've been obsessed before. I once spent three straight days learning to solve a Rubik's cube when I was fifteen, didn't eat properly, didn't sleep. So it's possible. I just haven't found the research equivalent of that yet.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-12

Okay so something weird happened today. I was in the library trying to read papers and I got a LinkedIn message from this startup in Singapore. They saw my GitHub and want to interview me for a bioinformatics engineer role. Not a PhD program, just a job. With a salary. And the office is in Singapore which—I've never been to Singapore.

I know I should just delete it. I'm in the middle of a PhD. You don't just leave a PhD for a random job opportunity. That's what my parents would say. That's what Sharma would say. That's what everyone would say.

But I haven't deleted it yet. It's just sitting there in my inbox like a little door that's cracked open. The company does something with personalized medicine and CRISPR delivery. Actually kind of interesting? I watched their YT videos for like an hour instead of reading papers. The office has this rooftop garden and the team seems young and the founder used to be at MIT before she moved back to Asia.

I messaged Rani about it—she's my cousin in Mumbai who actually works in tech—and she was like "bro at least do the interview, what do you have to lose?" And I was like "my entire academic career?" And she was like "your career isn't a vase, it won't break if you explore options."

I don't know. I'm probably making this into a bigger thing than it is. It's just one LinkedIn message.

**Nudge:** "You spent an hour on their videos—what kept you watching?"

**Response:** I think it was the founder's story actually. She was in a top PhD program, left after her second year, started this company, and now they're actually helping people? Like real patients. Not in ten years when a paper gets published and maybe influences a treatment, but NOW. She kept talking about "velocity" in one of the videos—how fast they move from idea to implementation. And I realized I've never experienced that. Academia is so slow. Everything takes years. Peer review takes months. I feel like I'm moving through honey while the rest of the world is running. Maybe I'm just impatient. Maybe impatience is a character flaw I need to fix. Or maybe... I'm in the wrong environment.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-15

I did the interview. First round, just a thirty-minute video call with their head of engineering. I was so nervous I almost backed out twice but Rani talked me off the ledge. And it went... well? Like, really well? She asked me about my GitHub projects and actually seemed interested in the weird evolutionary algorithm thing I built for fun. In my PhD no one cares about that stuff, it's not "publishable."

She mentioned they're building something new—can't share details yet—but they need someone who can "think sideways." I've never been told I think sideways as a compliment before. Usually it's more like "Arjun, can you stay focused on the problem at hand?" There's a second round next week. I haven't told anyone except Rani.

**Nudge:** "Why keep it secret?"

**Response:** Because the moment I tell someone in the program, it becomes real. And then I'll have to defend it. Explain it. Justify it. And I don't know if I can. How do I explain to Dr. Sharma that I might leave his lab—the lab I specifically transferred into six months ago—for a startup job? He'll think I'm not serious. Everyone will think I'm not serious. And maybe they're right? Maybe I'm just chasing the next shiny thing again and this isn't any different from switching labs or going to Vietnam or any of the other times I've... anyway. One interview at a time.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-16

Second interview scheduled. My heart is doing weird things. Also I definitely bombed my committee meeting today because I couldn't focus but whatever.

**Nudge:** "What happened in the committee meeting?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-21

Timeline of the past week:
- Monday: Second round interview. Went four hours. Met six people. Took a technical assessment that was actually fun.
- Tuesday: Couldn't focus on lab work. Kept checking email.
- Wednesday: They asked for references. Panicked. Gave Rani's contact and my undergrad advisor.
- Thursday: Dr. Sharma asked if everything was okay. Apparently I've been "distracted." Lied and said family stuff.
- Friday: Offer came in.

They want me to start in January. Salary is more than my stipend obviously. Relocation assistance. Singapore work visa they'll sponsor. The role is basically building their data pipeline from scratch.

I haven't responded yet. I have until next Friday. I've been sitting in my apartment for three hours just staring at the wall. I called Amma and she asked about my research and I said it was going great. I'm a terrible son.

Facts I'm trying to process:
1. If I leave, I won't have a PhD.
2. If I stay, I might still not get a PhD (dropout rates are real).
3. Singapore is 13 hours by flight from Bangalore. The US is 22 hours.
4. I've never lived in Southeast Asia long-term but I loved traveling there.
5. My apartment lease ends in January anyway.
6. I don't know what I want.

**Nudge:** "Forget the facts for a sec—what's your gut say?"

**Response:** Gut is overrated. Gut is what made me switch labs twice. Gut is what made me book a flight to Hanoi three hours after a breakup. My gut has historically terrible judgment and everyone in my life would agree. Maybe that's the problem—I've always followed my gut and look where it got me: 24 years old, no finished degrees past undergrad, no savings, and a LinkedIn message away from blowing up my life again.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-21

Entry number two today because I can't shut my brain off. Went for a walk around campus and ended up sitting by the fountain for like two hours. This undergrad came up and asked if I was okay and I was like "yeah just having a quarter-life crisis, normal stuff."

The thing is—and I've been avoiding thinking about this—the thing is that even if Singapore goes badly, even if it's a huge mistake, at least I'll KNOW. I'll know what it's like to work at a startup. I'll know what it's like to live in Singapore. I'll have that data. Right now I'm operating on pure hypothesis. "Maybe academia isn't for me" is a theory, not a fact. The only way to get facts is to run the experiment.

But experiments have costs. If I leave and it fails, I can't just come back and pick up where I left off. The PhD window closes. And I'm not sure I can start over again at 26 or 27. There's something about the timing that feels like now or never.

Aditya texted me asking if I wanted to grab dinner. I said I was busy. I've been saying I'm busy a lot lately. I think he knows something's up. I'm a terrible friend and a terrible son and maybe just a terrible person who can't commit to anything or anyone.

**Nudge:** "Terrible person for... considering options?"

**Response:** When you put it like that it sounds ridiculous. But it's not just this one decision, it's the pattern. It's always something with me. New city, new project, new plan. My parents have been patient for years and I keep changing directions. Aditya sticks with things. My cousin Rohan finished his MBA in two years flat, married his college girlfriend, stable job at Deloitte. Everyone else seems to have figured out how to commit and I'm over here treating my life like a buffet, sampling everything, finishing nothing. At some point that stops being "exploration" and starts being "avoidance," right?

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-21

Third entry today. Decided to accept the offer. Sent the email. Going to Singapore in January.

**Nudge:** "How do you feel right now?"

---

## Entry 8 - 2025-11-26

Told Dr. Sharma yesterday. He was... actually really nice about it? I expected disappointment or anger but he just said "Arjun, you've always seemed like you were searching for something. I hope you find it." Which made me cry a little bit, not gonna lie. He said if I ever want to come back to academia, he'd write me a letter. That was generous. More generous than I deserved probably.

Told Amma and Papa last night. That was harder. Amma went quiet for a long time and then said "so no PhD?" and I said "not right now" and she said "okay" and passed the phone to Papa who talked about health insurance for twenty minutes. I think it's their way of processing. They didn't yell which is something. Rohan apparently defended me—said tech is where the money is anyway, maybe this is smart. I'll take whatever allies I can get.

Now I'm in this weird in-between space. Still going to lab every day because technically I haven't withdrawn yet, but everyone knows. Aditya hugged me when I told him and said "you crazy bastard, I knew it." We got biriyani delivered and he didn't even lecture me about being impulsive which is growth for him.

I'm scared. I should say that. I'm really scared. But also there's this fizzy feeling in my chest that I haven't felt in a long time. Like when I booked the Vietnam trip, or when I switched to Sharma's lab. It's the feeling of something NEW coming. I know that feeling can't be trusted completely but god it's good when it's here.

**Nudge:** "What makes that feeling untrustworthy?"

**Response:** History, I guess? Every time I feel like this, I tell myself "this is it, this is the thing, this will be different." And then six months later or a year later I'm feeling stuck again and looking for the next exit. So I don't know if this is genuine alignment with what I want or just my brain's addiction to novelty dressed up as insight. But I guess I'll find out. Worst case, I get a year in Singapore, learn some stuff, and figure out my next move. Best case... I don't know what best case looks like yet. That's kind of exciting too.

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-03

Packing is harder than I thought. Every item is a decision. Also found my old journal from undergrad where I wrote "I will definitely finish my PhD" in all caps.

**Nudge:** "That undergrad version of you—what would he think?"

**Response:** Probably that I'm a flake. But also that kid had never tried and failed at anything substantial yet. He didn't know what two years of incremental research feels like. He just knew PhDs sounded impressive. I'm trying not to be too hard on either version of myself—the one who wrote that and the one who's walking away from it now. We're both just trying to figure it out.

---

## Entry 10 - 2025-12-04

People keep asking if I'm "sure" about this. Yes I'm sure. I mean, I signed the contract, booked the flight, told everyone—what else is "sure" supposed to look like?

**Nudge:** "Is anyone asking that you haven't already asked yourself?"

**Response:** No. That's the thing. I've asked myself a thousand times. Am I running away? Am I being impulsive? Am I disappointing everyone? What if I hate it? What if I'm just fundamentally incapable of staying anywhere? I've interrogated this decision from every angle. But at some point you just have to move. Uncertainty doesn't go away by thinking harder. You have to actually live through the thing to know if it was right. So yeah, I'm sure—not sure it's the right choice, but sure that I need to make A choice. Staying in a PhD I'm not committed to isn't safety, it's slow suffocation. Whatever Singapore is, at least it'll be something different.
