## Entry 0 - 2025-04-15

My mother-in-law rearranged Sami's entire nap schedule without asking me. She told Tariq it was better for the baby to sleep earlier so she could take him to the park in the afternoon. Nobody asked what I thought. I had finally gotten him into a rhythm that gave me two hours in the evening to work on a logo project. That's gone now.

I stood there in the kitchen holding a cup of tea and I just didn't say anything. Tariq looked at me like he expected me to agree. His mother was already moving the crib blanket to the other room. I could feel my jaw clenching but I smiled. I hate that I smiled. Something about the way everyone just decided felt like they forgot I'm his mother, not a guest in this arrangement.

**Nudge:** "You smiled but didn't want to. What stopped you?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-20

Sami had a fever all night. I was up every two hours. Tariq slept through it. His mother came in at 5am and took over, told me to rest. I should be grateful but it felt like being dismissed. I'm the one who knows what dose of medicine to give, what temperature means we go to the clinic. I didn't rest.

**Nudge:** "What would the right kind of help look like?"

**Response:** If she had asked. Just asked. "Can I sit with him so you can sleep?" instead of walking in and lifting him out of my arms. It's not the help. It's that nobody checks if I want it first.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-21

Sami's fever broke. Normal day otherwise. Did laundry, made lentil soup, swept the hallway because nobody else notices the dust. Tariq came home and asked what's for dinner. I said soup. He said his mother already made something. So the soup is in the fridge now, I guess.

Finished a draft of the logo I've been working on. The client wants revisions but at least the base concept is solid. I had to work on it in the bathroom because Sami was asleep in the bedroom and the living room was occupied. Sat on the edge of the bathtub with my laptop balanced on the hamper. It's ridiculous but it's the only place I can close a door without anyone asking what I'm doing.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-27

Can barely keep my eyes open. Sami is teething and it's been three nights of broken sleep. I had to email the client and ask for an extension on the logo revisions. Felt pathetic typing that out. My mother called to say my cousin Rania is getting engaged and when am I bringing Sami to visit. Everything requires something from me and I have nothing left to give right now.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-02

Eid preparations are consuming the entire house. Tariq's mother has been cooking since dawn. She made ma'moul and knafeh and keeps sending me to the store for things she forgot. I don't mind the errands but she keeps correcting how I arrange the pastries on the tray. Told me that's not how they do it in their family. It's been two years, I still arrange things wrong apparently.

Tariq gave me money to buy a new outfit for Eid. I picked something I liked -- a dark green dress with embroidery on the sleeves. When I showed it to his mother she said it was pretty but maybe something more "appropriate for a young mother" would be better. I don't even know what that means. I put the dress in my closet anyway. I'll wear it.

My own mother sent a voice note about how she wishes I could spend Eid at their house this year. First Eid is always with the husband's family, she knows that, but she said it anyway. So now I feel guilty about being here and guilty about not being there. Sami won't remember any of this. I'm doing all of it for people who have opinions about trays and dresses.

**Nudge:** "You said you'll wear the dress anyway. What's riding on that?"

**Response:** It's just a dress. I liked it, I bought it, I'll wear it. Not everything has to be a statement.

Later. Wore the dress. Tariq said I looked nice. His mother didn't comment. My sister-in-law Huda actually asked where I got it. Sami grabbed the embroidery and pulled a thread loose, which honestly made me laugh. Small thing but I felt like myself for the first time in weeks. I held Sami on my hip and I felt steady.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-05

Got the payment for the logo project. Not a lot -- 45 JD -- but I earned it. Put it in the envelope I keep in my underwear drawer. I have about 200 JD saved now. I don't know what I'm saving for exactly. Maybe a better laptop. Maybe just proof that I can do something that isn't cooking and wiping noses.

Tariq doesn't know about the envelope. I'm not hiding it because I think he'd be angry, more because he'd want to "help manage it" and then it wouldn't feel like mine anymore. My father always handled my mother's money. She'd get her teacher's salary and hand it over and he'd decide what the household needed. She never complained about it. I think about that a lot. I don't want to not complain about it. I want a reason not to need to.

**Nudge:** "What changes if Tariq finds that envelope?"

**Response:** He'd probably be fine with it. Supportive even. But then it becomes a shared thing, a family decision. Right now it's the only thing in this house that belongs to just me. I'm not ready to give that up. Maybe that's selfish. I don't care.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-06

Took Sami to the park near the mosque this morning. He's getting better at walking on his own, barely needs my hand now. He kept crouching down to look at ants. We stayed for almost two hours. I didn't bring my phone on purpose.

Ran into Um Fadi from the building. She asked if I was working these days, meaning a real job. I said no, just home with Sami. She nodded the way people nod when they think they're being polite but their face says everything. I used to let that bother me. Today I just picked Sami up and pointed at a bird and we moved on.

Tariq's mother made mansaf for dinner and I helped her roll the jameed. She showed me her mother's technique with the wooden spoon and for once it wasn't corrective, it was like she was sharing something. I actually paid attention. Her hands move fast for someone her age. The rice came out perfectly and she said "you're learning" and I think she meant it warmly. These moments confuse me because they make me forget why I'm frustrated. Or maybe they're exactly why I stay patient through the rest of it.

Friday. Tariq took the day off and we went to his parents' village with Sami to visit his grandfather. The old house has a courtyard with a lemon tree that Tariq's grandmother planted. His grandfather told Sami the same story he tells everyone about building the house stone by stone. Sami just chewed on a lemon leaf.

I sat with the women while the men did their thing. Tariq's aunt made sage tea the old way, on a brass tray over coals. It was good. Quiet. I sketched some patterns on a napkin -- the tile work in the courtyard is beautiful, these geometric interlocking shapes I've been wanting to use in a design project. Nobody noticed me drawing, which was the whole point.

New client reached out through Instagram. Wants a logo for a women's fitness studio in West Amman. Paying 80 JD. I said yes before thinking about when I'd actually do the work. Sami's not sleeping well again and the house is never empty. But 80 JD is 80 JD. I'll figure out the hours somehow. I always do.

**Nudge:** "You keep saying you'll figure it out. Figure out what exactly?"

**Response:** How to be two people at once. The one who takes care of Sami and the house and keeps everyone comfortable. And the one who wants to make things and get paid for it and have something that's mine. There's no schedule that fits both. I just keep squeezing one into the gaps of the other.

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-22

Tariq and I had an actual conversation last night. Not a fight. He asked why I've been staying up so late and I almost lied but I was too tired to come up with something so I told him about the freelance work. All of it. The clients, the envelope, the bathroom laptop sessions.

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said he wished I'd told him sooner. Not because he wanted to control it but because he felt stupid not knowing. That stung. I told him it wasn't about trust, it was about needing something that was just mine. He said he understood that but it still felt like I didn't trust him. I don't know if he's wrong.

We didn't resolve anything exactly. He said he'd talk to his mother about giving me more space during the day so I don't have to hide. I told him I don't want him to fight that battle for me. He looked confused. I think he genuinely doesn't understand why I'd rather struggle alone than have him fix it. Honestly, I'm not totally sure I understand it either. But the thought of his mother knowing about the work and having opinions about it makes my chest tight. Some things I need to handle my own way, even if my way is harder.

**Nudge:** "He offered help and you said no. What are you protecting?"

**Response:** Can we not do this right now. I already spent all night turning this over in my head. I know it doesn't make total sense. I just need to sit with it for a bit.

## Entry 11 - 2025-05-22

Same day, later. Tariq's mother asked me at dinner if everything was okay between us. She must have heard us talking last night. I said everything was fine. Tariq backed me up. She didn't push it. But the way she looked at me -- not unkind, just knowing -- made me feel exposed. I keep building walls in a house made of thin ones.
