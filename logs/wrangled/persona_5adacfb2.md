## Entry 0 - 2025-01-04

Uncle Faisal brought up university again at Friday lunch. Sat there smiling while baba nodded along like I haven't been paying my own phone bill since I was nineteen. Nobody asks how many drivers I'm running now or that I closed a deal with two new restaurants this week.

**Nudge:** "Sounds like you wanted them to see something different."

**Response:** I wanted them to see that I'm building something. That I'm not just some kid running errands on a scooter. But in their heads the only version of success they understand has a degree attached to it.

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-07

One of my riders, Sami, asked if he could take Friday off for a family thing. I said yes but it threw the whole schedule off and I ended up doing his route myself. Kept thinking about whether being the one who fixes everything is sustainable or if I just can't stand not being in the middle of it.

**Nudge:** "What would it feel like to let someone else handle it?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-13

Met with the owner of Shawarma House on Mecca Street about getting their lunch deliveries. He kept talking to his manager instead of me, asking him questions like I was some intern. I'm the one who handles the logistics, I'm the one signing the agreement, but apparently I don't look old enough to be taken seriously.

Got the deal in the end because my prices were better than the other guy's. But the whole meeting left a bad taste. I keep replaying the moments where he looked past me. I should be used to it by now—people always underestimate the young one in the room—but it still gets under my skin every time.

**Nudge:** "What would've made it feel like a real win?"

**Response:** If he'd looked me in the eye and talked to me directly. If he'd treated the meeting like I was the one making decisions, not some errand boy. The money is good but I need people to understand who they're dealing with.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-17

Good day actually. Had all three scooters running, no breakdowns, deliveries going smooth. Sami and Yousef both hit their targets and I told them I'd add a small bonus this week. Felt good telling them that, like I'm actually running something real. Standing in the kitchen tracking the routes on my phone and for a second it felt like I had a grip on things.

My friend Khaled called to see if I wanted to come play football but I told him I had to stay on the routes. Truth is the routes were fine, I just didn't want to step away. When things are going well I want to be right there watching it happen. Maybe that's weird but I don't trust good days to last if I'm not paying attention.

## Entry 4 - 2025-01-17

Second entry today because something's been sitting with me since this morning. Baba asked if I could help in the shop tomorrow because his back is bad again. I said fine but inside I was annoyed. It's his shop, his thing—he never asks my opinion on how to run it, never treats me like I might actually know something about business.

But then I thought about it more and realized part of the annoyance is that when I'm in his shop I'm just his son moving boxes. Not the guy managing a fleet. I shrink in that space and I hate it. I don't think he does it on purpose. He just doesn't see me the way I need to be seen.

**Nudge:** "What would it take to feel like yourself there?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-01-20

Yousef quit today. Said he got a warehouse job that pays steady. I told him good luck but when he left I punched the wall in my room. Losing a rider means losing a route means losing income.

**Nudge:** "Was the anger about the lost route, or something else?"

**Response:** Both. He was my first hire. I trained him, gave him a shot when nobody else would. And he just walks away like it meant nothing. Like what I built wasn't worth staying for.

## Entry 6 - 2025-01-23

Spent the morning interviewing two guys to replace Yousef. One of them, Issa, seemed okay but kept asking about hours and breaks before even asking what the job was. The other one, Nader, was hungrier—reminded me of myself when I started. I told him he could do a trial run tomorrow. Already planning his routes in my head.

I notice I always pick the one who reminds me of me. The one who wants it. Khaled says I should pick the reliable one but reliable is boring. I want someone who's going to hustle because they want to prove something, not just clock in and clock out. Maybe that's a mistake. Yousef was reliable and he still left. At least with the hungry ones you know what drives them.

**Nudge:** "Has picking the hungry one worked out before?"

**Response:** Honestly, it's fifty-fifty. Some of them burn bright and then flame out. But the ones who stay—they get it, they understand what we're building. Sami was like that. He's still here. I'd rather have one Sami than three guys who don't care.

## Entry 7 - 2025-01-25

Nader didn't show up for his trial. Didn't call, didn't text. I covered his entire route myself, thirteen deliveries in the rain. My hands are still shaking from the cold.

**Nudge:** "You chose him because he reminded you of yourself."

**Response:** Yeah. And I was wrong. Or maybe he's exactly like me and decided he didn't want to answer to someone else. I don't know which is worse.

## Entry 8 - 2025-01-25

Can't sleep so I'm writing again. Today wore me out but it's not just the deliveries. I keep thinking about this pattern where I put myself at the center of everything and then get angry when people don't orbit around me the way I want. Yousef left because the warehouse was better for him. Nader didn't show because he had his own reasons. Neither of them owed me anything beyond the work.

But it doesn't feel that way. It feels like when people leave or let me down, they're saying what I'm building doesn't matter. And if what I'm building doesn't matter then what am I? Just some guy with three scooters and a spreadsheet. My mother keeps telling me I work too hard and I should find a girl and settle down like my cousin Ahmad. Ahmad works at a bank. Ahmad has a car. But Ahmad also asks his father permission before he goes anywhere and I'd rather eat glass than live like that.

I think the reason I can't let go of anything—the routes, the negotiations, even the small stuff—is because the moment I'm not in charge of something, I feel like I'm nobody. That's not a comfortable thing to write down. I don't know what to do with it. But Yousef quitting and Nader ghosting in the same week made something crack open and I'm just sitting here looking at it.

**Nudge:** "What are you seeing now that cracked open?"

**Response:** That maybe I've been so focused on people respecting me that I forgot to ask if I respect myself without all of this. Like if the scooters disappeared tomorrow and I was just Tariq, not Tariq who runs a fleet—would that be enough? I don't think I know the answer yet.

## Entry 9 - 2025-01-31

Hired Issa after all—the "reliable" one Khaled told me about. He did his first full week and showed up every day on time. Not flashy, doesn't try to impress me, just does the work. I'm not used to that being enough but I'm trying to let it be.

Had dinner at home tonight and baba asked about the business for the first time without me bringing it up. He asked how many restaurants I work with now and when I said eleven he went quiet for a second and then said "ya'ni, that's more than I thought." It wasn't a celebration or anything. But he looked at me differently, even for a moment, and I carried that home with me like it was something fragile.

I keep coming back to what I wrote last week about needing to be in charge to feel like somebody. I don't think that feeling goes away overnight. But today Issa handled the west Amman routes without me checking in once, and baba acknowledged my work without me having to perform it for him. Two small things. Neither of them was about me being in control. Both of them felt good in a way I wasn't expecting. I'm not saying I've figured anything out. But maybe not everything has to go through me for it to count.
