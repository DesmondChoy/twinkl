Good class today. The students actually debated about the new coastal development project instead of just waiting for me to give them the "right" answer. These moments remind me why I chose this path.

**Nudge:** "What made them engage differently today?"

Long day. Parent-teacher meetings are draining in a way that teaching never is. One parent spent twenty minutes explaining why her son shouldn't have to learn about "foreign problems" like ocean pollution. I tried to explain that the Arabian Sea is not foreign to Kerala, but I could see her eyes glazing over.

Then the principal pulled me aside afterward to suggest I "tone down the activism" in my lessons. Said some parents have been complaining. I nodded and said I'd think about it. Not sure what I'm supposed to think about, honestly.

**Nudge:** "What did that nod cost you?"

Spent the weekend thinking about the principal's comment. I talked it over with Arjun and he made a good point - I can either fight every battle loudly and burn out, or I can be strategic. Pick what matters most and find ways to teach it that don't raise red flags.

I don't love the idea of softening my approach. But I also know that if I get pushed out, whoever replaces me will probably just teach straight from the textbook. At least I'm here. At least these kids are asking questions about their own coastline. That has to count for something.
