# Persona 0da16411: Maya Reyes

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 0da16411
- **Name:** Maya Reyes
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Gig Worker
- **Culture:** North American
- **Core Values:** Universalism
- **Bio:** Maya is a 22-year-old delivery driver and occasional food service worker who grew up in Portland, Oregon. She routinely donates part of her tips to bail funds and mutual aid networks, often leaving herself short on groceries. Her apartment walls are covered with flyers for immigrant rights rallies and watershed cleanup events, and she spends most of her downtime researching which companies to boycott. The weight of knowing about factory conditions or border detention centers keeps her up at night, and she feels guilty whenever she prioritizes her own rent over another fundraiser.

Saw three separate GoFundMe links for families facing eviction tonight and I can't even cover my own electric bill this month. Keep refreshing the news about the water crisis in Arizona while my shift notifications are piling up.

**Nudge:** "which part is weighing on you more right now?"

**Response:** The eviction ones. I sent $20 to one family but then immediately panicked about my own rent being due in a week.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-11

Spent six hours doing deliveries in the rain, came home and just sat on the floor scrolling through reports about garment workers in Bangladesh. There's this photo of a kid maybe ten years old covered in fabric dust and I'm wearing a hoodie that probably came from a place just like that. Deleted my cart from three different stores because I started looking up their labor practices.

My roommate asked why I looked so wrecked and I couldn't explain that it wasn't the deliveries. It's like every single purchase decision has become this massive moral calculation and I'm losing. Bought the cheap eggs again because the good ones were $8 and I'd already donated to that legal defense fund. Then felt disgusting about the cheap eggs for an hour.

Can't tell if this is what being informed is supposed to feel like or if I'm just making myself useless by caring about everything and helping no one enough. Either way I'm exhausted and I still have a morning shift tomorrow.

**Nudge:** "sounds like something's not sitting right about that choice?"

**Response:** It's not even about the eggs really. It's that I know buying them funds an industry that's horrible to animals and workers, but I also know that $4 difference could go to something that actually saves a person right now. So I'm making these calculations like I'm some kind of ethical accountant but at the end of it I still bought the torture eggs and I'm still not giving enough to anything that matters.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-16

Got into it with my mom on the phone because she doesn't understand why I'm "throwing money away" on causes. She kept saying I need to take care of myself first and I tried to explain that there are people who don't have the option to take care of themselves because the whole system is rigged against them. She just kept repeating "you can't help anyone if you're drowning."

Maybe she's right but it feels so selfish to just focus on my own stability when I know what's happening to people at the border, or to the people losing their homes, or to every ecosystem we're destroying. Like how do you just go to brunch and pretend the world isn't on fire? I can't unknow what I know.

**Nudge:** "how did you leave things with her?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-16

Still thinking about that call. She said something about how I'm "hurting myself to prove a point" and that landed weird. I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to not be complicit.

Went to the rally for farmworker protections this afternoon and felt a little less alone. There were maybe forty people there which is both encouraging and depressing—like, only forty of us could show up? But at least it's forty. Handed out flyers for two hours and my feet hurt but it felt better than sitting at home spiraling.

**Nudge:** "what part of that comment stuck with you?"

**Response:** I don't know, it just did. She doesn't get it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-18

Started researching the supply chain for phone manufacturing and now I'm staring at my phone feeling sick. There's no ethical way to exist under this system.

**Nudge:** "feeling stuck with that realization?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-20

Delivered food to this massive house today with a three-car garage and I couldn't stop thinking about the homeless encampment I drove past on the way there. The tip was $3 on a $70 order. Wanted to scream.

Came home and there was a text thread going around about another fundraiser for someone's medical bills and I'm just so tired of living in a country where we have to beg strangers on the internet to not die. Sent what I could but it's never enough. It's never going to be enough because the problem is structural and I'm just one person with a broken-down car and $200 in my account.

**Nudge:** "what would enough look like?"

**Response:** I don't even know anymore. Sometimes I think enough would be burning the whole system down and starting over. Like real redistribution, not just charity. But that's not happening in my lifetime so I'm stuck doing this pointless damage control where I give away what little I have and it doesn't actually change anything. And then I feel guilty for even wanting to keep enough for myself to like, go to the dentist or whatever.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-21

Someone at the coffee shop this morning made a comment about how people who complain about corporations still use smartphones and I almost lost it. Like yeah, Susan, I'm using a phone because I literally need it to work and survive, not because I think Apple is great. What am I supposed to do, go live in the woods and forage? That's not a solution, that's just individual escapism.

The whole "no ethical consumption under capitalism" thing gets mocked but it's true. We're all trapped in systems we didn't create and doing our best within them. I'm not a hypocrite for existing in the world while also trying to make it less horrible. I'm researching boycotts, I'm showing up to protests, I'm donating what I can—that's not nothing just because I also need to eat and pay rent.

I think what actually bothers me is that people use that gotcha to avoid examining their own choices. Like if I'm imperfect then they're off the hook for doing anything at all. Meanwhile I'm over here losing sleep about whether my laundry detergent is tested on animals and they're buying whatever's on sale without a second thought. It's not about being perfect, it's about trying. At least I'm trying.

**Nudge:** "sounds like you've got clarity on where you stand"

**Response:** Yeah. I mean I still feel like I'm failing most of the time but at least I know I'm failing while giving a shit. That has to count for something. And maybe if enough people actually tried we could shift things, even a little. Better than just accepting everything as it is.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-21

Signed up to volunteer at the river cleanup next weekend. Read through the data on microplastics in the watershed and it's worse than I thought. They're finding particles in fish tissue, in sediment, basically everywhere. The lead organizer sent around a document about which corporations are the biggest polluters in the region and it's mostly companies I see trucks for every single day on my delivery routes.

Felt good about signing up for maybe an hour and then started thinking about how we're essentially doing free labor to clean up messes that corporations made and will keep making. Like we'll pull trash out of the river for a day and then what? They're still dumping chemicals upstream, they're still producing single-use everything, they're still operating with zero accountability. And we're the ones spending our weekends trying to undo a tiny fraction of the damage.

Not saying I won't go. I'll go. Just sitting with how absurd it is that regular people have to organize to protect basic things like clean water while the actual responsible parties face no consequences. We shouldn't have to do this. But if we don't, no one will.

**Nudge:** "sounds like you're going anyway though"

**Response:** Yeah. Because the alternative is watching it get worse and doing nothing. At least this is something, even if it's a bandaid on a gunshot wound.

River cleanup was good. Cold, wet, pulled out like fifty pounds of trash. Met some decent people.

**Nudge:** "what made them decent?"

**Response:** They actually cared. Weren't just there for photos or whatever. Talked about organizing more regular cleanups and pushing for policy changes.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-27

Someone asked if I wanted to grab lunch after and I said no because I couldn't afford it. Felt stupid.

**Nudge:** "stupid how?"

**Response:** Like they probably think I'm antisocial or something but really I'm just broke because I keep giving money away and I didn't want to have to explain that. It's easier to just be the weird quiet one than to get into why I don't have $12 for a sandwich.

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-27

Came home and just crashed for a bit. Was thinking about how good it felt to actually do something physical, something with a visible result. Like we pulled trash out of the water and now that trash isn't in the water anymore. That's real. That's tangible. Most of the time I'm just sending small amounts of money into voids and hoping it helps someone somewhere, or I'm reading articles that make me feel informed and helpless at the same time.

But also I can't shake this feeling that we're all just rearranging deck chairs. The river is cleaner for now but the plastic is still being produced, the chemicals are still being dumped, nothing structural has changed. We'll be back there in three months pulling out another fifty pounds. And that's good, we should do that, but it's not a solution. It's just maintenance on a dying patient.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do with that. Keep doing the cleanups and the donations and the protests and hope that somehow it adds up to something? Burn out and give up? Find a way to not care as much so I can function? None of those feel right. I'm just tired and I still have to work tomorrow and there's another fundraiser in my texts that I can't ignore. It doesn't stop. I don't know how to make it stop.

**Nudge:** "you showed up today though"

**Response:** Yeah. I guess. For whatever that's worth.
