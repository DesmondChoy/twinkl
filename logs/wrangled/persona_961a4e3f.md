## Entry 0 - 2025-11-14

Mummyji made a comment at lunch about the indigo stains on my fingernails. She didn't say anything directly, just that thing she does where she looks at my hands and then looks at the dal and raises her eyebrows. Ravi was right there and said nothing. I know he thinks the dyeing thing is fine, he's told me so, but he won't say it in front of her. So I'm the one who looks like I'm neglecting things.

The thing is, the kitchen was spotless. Lunch was on time. Arjun's tiffin was packed before school. I don't know what more she wants from me. Or maybe I do know and I just don't want to give it, which is this complete surrender of any time that's mine. Like the house should swallow me whole and I should be grateful for it.

I scrubbed the indigo off after lunch. Took ten minutes with lemon and baking soda. I shouldn't have had to do that. But I did it anyway and I'm not sure what that says about me.

**Nudge:** "Why did you scrub them off?"

**Response:** Because it was easier than sitting through another silent dinner with her staring at my hands. I pick my fights and that one wasn't worth it. But it felt like erasing something.

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-15

Arjun's parent-teacher meeting today. The class teacher mentioned he draws during free period instead of playing cricket with the other boys and asked if everything is okay at home. I wanted to say, yes, everything is fine, my son likes drawing, why is that a problem? But I smiled and nodded and said I'd encourage him to be more social.

Came home and told Ravi about it and he said maybe Arjun should join a sport, that it would be good for him. And I thought, here we go. Everyone has an opinion about what the boy should be doing except the boy himself.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from saying that to the teacher?"

**Response:** I don't know. You just don't, do you? Not in that setting.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-20

Made aloo paratha for breakfast the way Appa used to, with extra ajwain in the dough. The smell filled the whole kitchen and for a second I was back in our old house in Mysore, watching him roll them out, flour everywhere.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-23

Spent the whole morning at the Diwali mela helping set up the community puja. I did the rangoli at the entrance the way my grandmother taught me, rice flour with turmeric borders, none of the acrylic paint shortcuts the younger crowd uses. Three women came up and asked me to show them how. Felt good.

Later, back home, I worked on a new indigo resist pattern. Nobody was around to comment on it. Ravi had taken Arjun and Vihaan to the cricket match. Two hours of silence and my hands doing what they wanted to do. I didn't even check my phone.

**Nudge:** "Which part of the day stuck with you more?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-24

Mummyji wants me to start teaching Vihaan the Vishnu Sahasranama. He's seven. She says she learned it by six. I said I'd start next week, which I will, because it's important, Appa made sure I knew it by heart and I'm glad he did. But there's this edge to the way she asks, like she's testing whether I'm doing enough.

Ravi's cousin Priya called in the evening. She started a small catering business last year and wanted to know if I'd be interested in supplying hand-dyed table linens. I said I'd think about it. Didn't mention it to anyone at home yet.

**Nudge:** "Are you going to tell Ravi about Priya's offer?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-30

Sat down this morning to teach Vihaan the first twenty verses. He's quicker than I expected. He kept asking what the words meant and I found myself explaining them properly, not just the rote way I was taught but actually talking about what each name describes. He asked why Vishnu has so many names and I said because one name is never enough for something that big. He seemed satisfied with that.

It reminded me of sitting with Appa in the puja room, early mornings, the smell of camphor and sandalwood paste. He was patient. He never rushed me or made it feel like a chore. I want to give Vihaan that same feeling, not the pressure of getting it right, but the warmth of sitting together with something that matters. The sense that this is ours, this thread that connects us backward through generations, something nobody can take away or schedule over.

Mummyji passed by the room and listened for a while and actually smiled. She didn't say anything, didn't correct his pronunciation or mine. She just stood there and smiled. That was enough for today.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-30

Spent the afternoon cataloguing my dye samples. I have fourteen shades of indigo now, ranging from almost-grey to a deep navy that I got by double-dipping with a fermentation vat I built from a recipe in an old Kalamkari manual. Labelled each one with the mordant used, the dip count, the fabric type. Cotton takes differently than silk, and I'm getting more consistent results with the cotton muslin I sourced from a weaver in Solapur.

Priya messaged again about the linens. She has a wedding order for February. Twelve table runners, twenty napkins. The money would be decent. I told her I need to think about scale. My terrace setup can handle maybe four meters of fabric at a time. I'd need to figure out drying space and timing around the kids' schedules.

Vihaan came up to the terrace after his homework and asked if he could dip his hand in the vat. I let him. His palm came out blue and he ran downstairs to show everyone. Mummyji was not pleased.

**Nudge:** "So are you doing it?"

**Response:** Haven't decided. Need to work out the logistics first.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-02

Told Ravi about Priya's proposal over chai after the boys went to bed. He was more supportive than I expected. He said if I wanted to try it, he'd help me figure out the money side. He even suggested converting part of the back store room into a workspace. I hadn't thought about that.

What surprised me was my own hesitation. He was offering exactly what I thought I wanted, backing, space, permission. But when it was right there in front of me I felt this pull backward, like, who am I to run a business? My mother didn't. Mummyji didn't. All the women I grew up watching ran homes, not enterprises. And I love running this home. That's the part that gets lost when people hear I want to do something else. I don't want to leave, I want to also.

**Nudge:** "What does 'also' actually look like day to day?"

**Response:** Mornings with the boys, school drop-off, puja, cooking. Afternoons when they're in school or doing homework, that's my window. Three, maybe four hours. It's not a lot but it's mine. I just need people to stop treating those hours like leftover time that belongs to the house.

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-07

Mummyji brought up the store room idea at dinner, in front of Ravi's parents who were visiting. She said something like, "Meera is thinking of opening a factory in the house." She was smiling but it was the wrong kind of smile. Ravi's father asked what she was talking about and I had to explain the dyeing and the linen idea in front of everyone while trying not to sound like I was defending myself.

Ravi stepped in eventually and said it was just a small project. The word "small" stuck. I know he was trying to help but it felt like he was shrinking it to make it palatable. I didn't say anything after that. Finished dinner. Cleared the plates. Went upstairs.

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-07

Can't sleep. Ravi's parents left after dinner and everyone is being normal now but I keep replaying the table conversation. The worst part isn't what Mummyji said, it's that nobody asked me a real question about it. Nobody said, what kind of fabric, what's the process, how did you learn. They only wanted to know if it would interfere with anything.

I keep thinking about Appa's workshop in Mysore. He repaired watches. Tiny, patient, precise work. Nobody ever questioned whether he should be doing it. It was just what he did. I want that. Not the permission, not the approval. Just the quiet assumption that of course I do this, it's mine.

**Nudge:** "What would Appa say about the indigo?"

## Entry 10 - 2025-12-14

Took the boys to the Ganesh temple this morning for the monthly abhishekam. Vihaan recited the first twenty verses of the Sahasranama on the auto ride there, unprompted. I didn't even know he'd been practising on his own. The priest noticed and said something to me about keeping these things alive. I felt proud but also this strange defensiveness, like I needed to prove I wasn't only about the dyeing, that I still carry all of this too.

Why do I feel like I have to choose? Like every hour I spend with the indigo is an hour stolen from something else. Nobody told Ravi he has to choose between his consulting work and being a father. It's just assumed he can be both.

**Nudge:** "Who's actually making you choose?"

## Entry 11 - 2025-12-14

Called Priya back tonight and said yes to the February order. Twelve runners, twenty napkins, indigo with a kalamkari-inspired border block I've been working on. She sounded happy. I felt terrified and then calm, in that order, like jumping into cold water.

Haven't told Mummyji yet. Told Ravi, who said congratulations and then asked if I needed help setting up the store room this weekend. I said yes. Vihaan overheard and asked if he could help with the blue. I said yes to that too. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. But I know I'm doing my thing, and right now that has to be enough.
