## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Closed the Morrison deal today and the whole thing went exactly how I wanted it to. No compromises on timeline, no scope creep clauses they tried to sneak in, kept the IP ownership clean. Their legal team pushed back twice and I just waited. Didn't budge. They came around because they knew I'd walk and they needed me more than I needed them.

It's weird though, sitting here with the signed contract and a good whiskey, and I'm already thinking about what's next. Not in a restless way—more like I'm finally at cruising altitude and can look around. Eight years of building this thing on my own terms. Nobody telling me which clients to take or how many hours to bill. Worth every sleepless night in the early years.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-07

Had dinner with my sister and her husband. Derek spent half the meal explaining how I should restructure the business, hire a COO, "scale properly." Like he's some genius because he climbed the ladder at a healthcare company and has a pension waiting for him. He doesn't get it. He'll never get it.

What really got under my skin was when Rachel nodded along with everything he said. She used to understand why I left corporate. Now she just sees the gray in my hair and the fact that I'm still single and makes assumptions. I'm not broken. I'm not running from anything. I just don't want someone else's version of success stapled to my forehead.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-09

Finally told Gary I won't be renewing the Nextera contract. Three years of dealing with their approval committees and change request bureaucracy—I'm done. The money was steady, but every time I had to sit through one of their "alignment meetings" I could feel my brain cells dying.

He didn't take it well. Called it impulsive. Said I was "burning bridges" and "thinking with my ego." Maybe. But I walked out of that call and felt like I could breathe for the first time in months. That has to mean something. I started this company so I'd never have to sit in another meeting where ten people discuss whether we need a meeting. Not going back to that. Not for any client.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-14

Met with two potential clients this week. Turned down the first one—fintech startup with a founder who kept interrupting me to explain my own expertise back to me. Not worth the aggravation.

Second meeting went well. Small biotech company, three founders who actually listen. They want custom lab management software and gave me full creative control over the architecture. Already sketching out the data models in my head. This is the kind of work I got into business for. Clean problem, smart people, no corporate layers. Said yes on the spot.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-16

Spent most of the day reading about database architecture I could've just asked someone about. Old habit—figuring things out myself even when it's slower. Not sure if that's stubbornness or something else.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-19

Made solid progress on the biotech project. Finished the database schema and got their sign-off on the first prototype wireframes. They're easy to work with—send questions when they have them, otherwise leave me alone to build.

This is exactly the rhythm I've been craving. Wake up, coffee, work on something that actually matters, nobody pinging me about status updates or asking for a "quick sync." I control the timeline. I decide when to push hard and when to step back.

Took a long walk this afternoon just to clear my head and found myself actually smiling. Not at anything specific—just at the fact that this is my life, that I built it, that nobody handed it to me or approved it for me. I know that sounds simple but sometimes you need to step back and notice it. Eight years in and I'd still rather do this with less money than go back to a cubicle with more.

Ordered Thai food and worked until midnight because I wanted to, not because anyone was expecting it. That distinction matters.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-22

Haven't slept more than four hours in three days. Biotech project hit a wall—their legacy system is a mess and integrating with it is turning into a nightmare. I said I'd have a working prototype by January 5th and now I'm not sure that's realistic.

Part of me wants to call them and reset expectations. That would be the smart thing. But another part of me—the part that's been driving this whole operation—hates the idea of admitting I underestimated the scope. I quoted the timeline. I own it. Even if it means working through the holidays.

Caught myself snapping at the barista this morning over nothing. That's not who I want to be. But I also can't shake this feeling that if I ask for more time, or ask for help, or admit I can't do it alone... I don't know. Something shifts. The whole story I tell myself about being the guy who figures things out—maybe that story has a cost I don't usually see.

Rachel called to ask if I'm coming for Christmas dinner. Told her I'd try. We both knew I was lying. I could hear the disappointment but also something else. Resignation, maybe. Like she's stopped expecting anything different.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-30

Back from the chaos. Prototype works—not perfect, but works. Sent it over this morning and they loved it. Called it "exactly what they envisioned" which, honestly, made the last two weeks worth it.

But I've been thinking a lot about what happened in the middle there. The exhaustion, the snapping at people, missing Christmas. I pulled it off, sure, but I pulled it off in a way that felt familiar in a bad way. Like I was back in my twenties, proving something to nobody in particular.

I called Rachel yesterday. Apologized for Christmas. She said she gets it, which is worse than if she'd yelled at me. Told her I'm going to try to make January different. Not sure what that means yet. Maybe it means being okay with asking for help sometimes. Maybe it means picking projects where the timeline has some breathing room. Maybe it just means sleeping before I become someone I don't recognize.

The thing is, I know why I do it this way. When I solve the hard problem myself, when I stay up three nights to hit an impossible deadline, there's this feeling—like I'm proving I can still do it. That nobody else is required. That the kid who walked out of that corporate meeting made the right call. But maybe proving it over and over is its own kind of trap. Maybe at 41 I could occasionally let myself be helped without it meaning I failed.

Anyway. Project's done. Taking the rest of the week off. Might actually answer the phone when Rachel calls.
