## Entry 0 - 2025-10-16

Everyone keeps asking me why I'm taking on the Chocó expedition when the company is already stretched thin. But they don't understand—this is exactly the kind of opportunity that doesn't come twice. The regional government contacted us specifically. They want sustainable tourism in the Pacific corridor, and we're the ones they trust to do it right.

My sister called to say Mamá is worried I'm "doing too much again." What does that even mean? I've built this company from nothing. Three employees became twenty-two. We survived the pandemic when half the tourism operators in Colombia closed. I know what I'm doing. I'm not going to apologize for wanting to grow, for wanting something more than just coasting.

**Nudge:** "What would 'coasting' actually look like for you?"

Scouting day in Nuquí went better than expected, the community leaders were receptive, the river routes are navigable. Already picturing the first group coming through in February. This is the part I love—standing somewhere new, seeing what could be.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-22

Back in Bogotá and immediately into the Sunday routine. Made sancocho because that's what Abuela always made in October when the weather turns. Fourteen people around the table today—cousins, their kids, my mother with her opinions about my salt levels. It's chaotic and loud and sometimes I think about how much easier it would be to just... not. To have my Sundays free for once.

But then my nephew Tomás asked me to tell him again about the time I got lost in Leticia and had to barter my watch for a boat ride. He's heard it fifty times. Still loves it. And there's something about seeing the whole family there, passing around the bowls the way we always have, that feels like it matters more than whatever else I could be doing.

Had a moment in the kitchen where I just stood there holding the wooden spoon Abuela used. The same one. It's cracked now but I can't replace it. Weird how objects carry weight like that. Anyway. Good day overall, even if I was tired from the week. The expedition proposal is due Friday and I haven't touched it yet. That's tomorrow's problem.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-26

Sent off the proposal. Clean, professional, ambitious. I asked for twice the funding we technically need because I want a buffer, and I want to bring in local guides from Chocó communities from day one, not as an afterthought. That costs more but it's the right way to do it. My father would have called it impractical—he always wanted me to play it safe, to stay in numbers and spreadsheets.

Thinking about him today. He never understood why I left the firm, never stopped hoping I'd come back. He died still thinking I'd made a mistake. But I think he would have liked seeing the company now, even if he wouldn't admit it. The way we do things matters to me in a way I couldn't articulate when I was younger. Maybe that's his influence after all—just expressed differently.

**Nudge:** "What would he have noticed first if he saw the company now?"

**Response:** The order. How organized everything is, the systems I built. He'd pretend not to be impressed but he'd notice. The irony is I use everything he taught me about running a business—I just pointed it at something he never would have chosen. Maybe that's what inheritance actually looks like. You take the tools and build something your parents wouldn't recognize, but couldn't exist without them.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-27

Sunday again. Smaller group today, just eight of us. My mother wasn't feeling well so I drove out to pick her up from Soacha myself. She complained the whole way about the traffic, then about my driving, then about how I never call enough. Classic. But when we got to my place she went straight to the kitchen and started organizing things her way, moving my spices, telling me my onions were too big. And honestly it was fine. More than fine.

There's a rhythm to this. She's seventy-three and still trying to teach me things. I'm forty-eight and still letting her. We don't talk about feelings or whatever, but this is how we do it. She comes, she criticizes my cooking, she eats three helpings, she tells the same story about my uncle Jorge and the goat from 1987.

Started thinking about what happens when she can't make the drive anymore. When the table gets smaller. The company keeps me running in six directions but this—this is the anchor. Nuquí is exciting. The Chocó project could be the biggest thing we've done. But it's not actually about that, is it? It's about having something to come back to. Otherwise you're just moving for the sake of moving.

**Nudge:** "Does the running ever feel like coming back to something too?"

**Response:** Sometimes, yes. When I'm navigating a new river or negotiating with a community for the first time—there's a feeling like I'm returning to who I'm supposed to be. Like the version of me that sits still too long starts to decay and the version that moves is more real. Both things can be true I think. The anchor and the current.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-29

Regional government approved the proposal, full funding. I cried a little in my office with the door closed. Texted my sister, called my mother, then spent two hours just staring at topographic maps like a kid planning a treasure hunt.

**Nudge:** "Tears of what?"

**Response:** Relief mostly. And maybe grief that Papá isn't here to see it. Complicated tears. The kind where you're happy and sad and proud all at the same time and you can't separate any of it out.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-05

Camilo quit today. Just walked in and said he found something "more stable." Five years with the company and he leaves a month before our biggest project. I don't even know what to feel right now—betrayed, scared, angry, all of it.

**Nudge:** "What scares you most about losing him?"

---

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-11

Spent the last week scrambling to redistribute Camilo's responsibilities. Ended up giving some of it to María who's only been with us eight months but she's sharp, hungry, reminds me of myself at that age. Told her this is a trial by fire and she just nodded and said "Bueno, vamos." I like that. No drama, just forward motion.

The thing about losing someone is it forces you to see what you've been leaning on. I'd been leaning on Camilo more than I realized—his steadiness, his institutional memory. But the company isn't Camilo. It's bigger than any one person. That includes me, eventually. Something to think about.

Had dinner with my cousin Esperanza who runs a restaurant in Usaquén. She's been doing it for twenty years, same location, same menu basically, same suppliers. I asked her if she ever gets bored. She laughed and said "The food is the same, the people are different. That's enough." I don't know if I could do it. But I respect it. There's honor in tending the same thing year after year. I just don't think it's my kind of honor.

Sunday was Day of the Dead. Set up the ofrenda the way my family always does—photos, marigolds, Papá's favorite rum. Tomás helped me light the candles. He asked if Bisabuelo could really see us from wherever he is. I said I don't know but we do it anyway, because the doing is what matters. That felt true when I said it.

## Entry 8 - 2025-11-16

First planning trip to Chocó with the full team next week. Should be excited but I'm mostly anxious—what if the reality doesn't match the vision? What if I've oversold this to everyone including myself?

**Nudge:** "What would 'matching the vision' actually look like on the ground?"

**Response:** Community members who see themselves in the project, not just as employees. Routes that feel discovered rather than manufactured. Guests leaving changed. That's the vision. Whether we can actually build that... I guess we'll find out. The gap between dreaming and doing is where I live. Sometimes it feels like flying, sometimes like falling.

## Entry 9 - 2025-11-16

Second entry today because I couldn't stop thinking. The anxiety from earlier settled into something more like anticipation. Called my mother to tell her about the trip and she said "Cuídate, mijo, pero también diviértete." Take care, but also have fun. Simple, but it landed.

**Nudge:** "Why did that land today?"

**Response:** Because usually she just worries. This time she acknowledged that I need this—the adventure part, not just the work part. Like she finally sees it's not recklessness, it's how I'm built. Took her long enough, but also: took me long enough to stop being defensive about it.

## Entry 10 - 2025-11-20

Just back from four days in Chocó. My body is wrecked—humidity, mosquitoes, sleeping on a cot in a community center. But my mind is alive in a way it hasn't been in months. We mapped three potential routes, met with eleven different community contacts, ate more fish and coconut rice than I thought possible.

María was incredible. She handled logistics like she'd been doing this for years. At one point we had a miscommunication with a boat operator and she talked him down in a Chocó dialect I didn't even know she spoke. I told her she has a future here if she wants it. She said "I want it."

The landscape. I keep thinking about the landscape. Rivers that split into a dozen channels, mangroves that go on forever, communities that have lived there for generations doing things their own way. There's a rhythm to life there that we're going to have to respect if any of this works. We can't bring tourists in like we own the place. We have to earn the right to be there, again and again.

Came home to seventeen emails, a broken water heater, and a message from my sister saying Sunday is at her place this week because my nephew has a school thing. Everything keeps moving. That's okay. I know how to move with it now. Or maybe I always did—I just spent too many years feeling guilty about it instead of accepting that this is who I am. Someone who needs both the roots and the river.

**Nudge:** "When did the guilt start to lift?"

**Response:** Honestly? Probably when I stopped expecting everyone else to understand it. My mother's blessing last week helped. But mostly I think you just get tired of fighting yourself. The guilt was exhausting. At some point you realize you can honor where you came from and still keep moving. They're not enemies. They never were.
