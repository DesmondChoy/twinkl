Spent most of the morning reviewing the same pull request I started Friday. Nothing wrong with it, just one of those days where your eyes slide over code without absorbing anything. Had chai with Suresh at lunch and he was talking about some new cloud migration project, and I kept thinking about whether Amma took her evening medication yesterday. I should set a reminder but Priya already handles it. I just worry.

Ananya came home from tuition looking drained. She barely touched the sambar. I wanted to ask how her mock exams went but Priya gave me that look, the one that means let her eat first. So I just sat there passing the rice. Normal Monday, I suppose.

Everyone keeps asking why I didn't take the fintech offer. Suresh brought it up again. I have a good position, my PF is solid, Amma and Appa are right here, and I don't need to justify that to anyone.

**Nudge:** "What exactly does Suresh say that gets under your skin?"

**Response:** He implies I'm too afraid to try something new.

Appa's knee specialist wants to do a second surgery. The first one was only eight months ago. I told Priya we should get another opinion, but she thinks the doctor knows best. I didn't push it but something doesn't sit right.

**Nudge:** "What part of the doctor's reasoning bothers you?"

**Response:** Maybe it's not the doctor. Maybe I'm scared of Appa going through all that pain again.

Quarterly review went fine. Same feedback as always — solid, dependable, keeps the team stable. Raghavan mentioned they might need someone to lead the new payments integration and my name came up, which is nice I guess. Nothing I haven't done before. Sometimes I wonder if that's a compliment or just inertia. Like they know I won't leave so they keep handing me things.

Vikram didn't come for Sunday puja again. Third week in a row. Priya says he's sixteen and it's normal, but she didn't grow up going to the temple every week with her thatha the way I did. It mattered. Not the prayers exactly, but sitting together, the smell of camphor, the drive back when my grandfather would explain some story from the epics. Vikram doesn't have that and I can't seem to make him want it.

Ananya at least still comes, though she spends half the time on her phone. Small mercies.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-14

Got an email from the fintech recruiter again. They bumped the package. Priya saw the notification on my phone and asked about it, and I told her it's nothing. She said she'd support whatever I decide, which somehow made it worse. If she'd just said don't take it, I could've closed the loop.

The thing is I looked at their Glassdoor page. Two rounds of layoffs in eighteen months. Equity that might be worth something or might be worth nothing. No real healthcare plan beyond some startup wellness thing. I have a daughter whose college fees start in two years and parents whose medical bills are only going up. People act like staying put is the coward's choice but they don't have my responsibilities.

Spent the rest of the evening helping Ananya with her physics. She's good at it. Better than I was at her age. That felt right, at least.

Made Paati's rasam recipe for the first time in months. The smell hit me and I had to step away from the stove for a minute. Priya finished it without saying anything.

**Nudge:** "What came up when you smelled it?"

**Response:** Her kitchen in Mylapore. Summer holidays. Being ten years old and not worrying about anything.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-24

Vikram announced at dinner that he doesn't want to do engineering. He wants to study film. Film. I didn't say anything for a while and Priya jumped in with something supportive, and Ananya was watching me like she was waiting for an explosion. I just asked him if he'd thought about it seriously and he said yes. That was it. Dinner went on.

But I'm sitting here now and I don't know what I feel. My father was an engineer. His father was a civil servant. There was a path. Not that anyone forced me — I genuinely loved circuits and code — but there was a shape to things. A structure. You studied something that led to something stable, and that stability let you take care of the people around you. What does film lead to? I don't even know what questions to ask.

The worst part is I can hear my own father's voice in my head, and he would have said the same things I'm trying not to say. And Vikram would resent me for it just like I sometimes resented Appa for being so rigid about my sister's choices.

**Nudge:** "So what are you going to say to him?"

**Response:** I don't know yet. I just don't want him to stop talking to me about it.

Talked to Amma about Vikram's film idea. She surprised me — said your Paati always wanted to learn Carnatic music but her father said no, and she carried that her whole life. I didn't know that about my grandmother. All those years cooking her recipes and I never knew she had a dream that got shut down.

Doesn't change the practical reality though. The film industry is brutal and unpredictable. I told Vikram I'd look into some programs with him, actual structured ones, not YouTube tutorials. If he's serious, there should be a proper path. Priya thinks I'm trying to control it and maybe she's half right, but I can't just say go for it with no plan. That's not how I'm built.

Work was uneventful. Accepted the payments integration lead role. Raghavan seemed relieved. Seventeen years and I'm still the person they hand things to when they need it done without drama.
