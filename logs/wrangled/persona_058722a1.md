Spent the entire afternoon at the community center helping Fatima with her citizenship application paperwork. Her English is getting so much better but the legal language still trips her up, and honestly it trips me up too. We went through every section three times to make sure nothing would get flagged. By the end my eyes were burning from staring at that tiny print.

But there was this moment when we finished and she grabbed my hands and just held them for a second without saying anything. Eight months ago she arrived here with two suitcases and three kids and now she's applying to become a citizen. I drove home feeling like maybe I actually did something that mattered today. The dishes were still in the sink and Mia needed help with her history project but for once I didn't feel bad about where my time went.

**Nudge:** "What usually makes a day feel like it didn't matter?"

**Response:** The days blur together sometimes. Errands, laundry, driving kids places. I know it matters, I know keeping a household running matters. But when I lie down at night after a day like that, I can't point to anything and say this moved the needle. This made something better. It's hard to explain without sounding ungrateful for the life I have.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-15

Conference at Mia's school tonight about the AP Environmental Science curriculum and I'm still replaying this one exchange in my head. Another parent, Deborah something, stood up and said the class was spending too much time on "doom and gloom climate stuff" and that her son was coming home anxious. And I wanted to say something, I had the words right there, but I just sat there.

The teacher looked uncomfortable and sort of backpedaled about how they try to balance the science with "solutions" and "hope." And I thought about Mia last week telling me she doesn't want to have kids because what's the point. And I thought about all the reports I've read. And I said nothing. Just sat there nodding like everyone else while Deborah congratulated herself for protecting her son from being sad about the world actually ending.

I should have spoken up. I teach my kids to speak up. But I was worried about making things awkward, worried about being that parent, worried about the car ride home with Mia being embarrassed. Now I'm sitting here at midnight wishing I could do it over.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you in that moment?"

**Response:** I think I was scared of my own anger. If I started talking I wasn't sure I could keep it civil. And there's this voice in my head that says people like Deborah can't be convinced anyway so why bother, why make yourself a target. But that's just an excuse isn't it. The teacher needed backup and I let her down.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-18

Recycling day. Pulled out three bags of perfectly recyclable materials that neighbors just threw in with their regular trash. Aluminum cans, glass jars, stuff that takes thirty seconds to rinse out. I sorted through it all anyway because what else am I going to do, let it go to the landfill?

Tom thinks I take this too seriously. He said as much when I came back inside smelling like someone's old salsa jar. He's not wrong that I can't fix everyone else's habits but he's also not standing in the garage at 7am picking yogurt containers out of a trash bag. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the crazy one, if normal people just throw things away and sleep fine at night and don't think about where it all ends up.

The kids have learned to separate everything correctly, at least. That's something. But then I think about the scale of it, the millions of tons, the plastic islands, and my little neighborhood project feels like putting a band-aid on a hemorrhage. And I keep doing it anyway because what's the alternative.

**Nudge:** "You said 'what's the alternative.' Do you actually have an answer to that?"

**Response:** Give up and stop caring, I guess. Which isn't really an alternative at all.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-25

Daniel's soccer game this morning, then dropped Mia at her study group, then grocery run, then made dinner for a family from the resettlement center whose mom just had surgery. Pretty standard Saturday honestly. I'm beat.

Noticed while shopping that they stopped carrying the fair trade coffee I usually get. Asked the manager and he said it wasn't selling enough. Ended up buying the regular kind because I needed coffee and didn't have time to go somewhere else. Small thing but it's been nagging at me all evening.

Mia asked if she could join me at the refugee center next week. Said she wanted to help with the kids' tutoring program. Didn't push her for a reason, just said yes.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-06

My sister called to catch up and somehow we ended up in this whole thing about how I spend my time. She asked when I was going to "go back to real work" since the kids are older now. As if what I do isn't work. As if coordinating thirty households' recycling and showing up for families who have no one else isn't real.

I didn't say any of that obviously. Just said I'm happy with how things are, which is mostly true. But later Tom asked what was wrong and I snapped at him for no reason. I know she doesn't mean it as a criticism, she just doesn't get it. Not everyone measures their life by a paycheck. I'm doing what feels right even if it looks like nothing on a resume.

**Nudge:** "What part of her question stung the most?"

**Response:** That she might be right. That maybe I'm hiding behind volunteer work because I'm scared I couldn't cut it in a real job anymore. That eight years out of the workforce, who would even hire me now. Easier to tell myself I'm making a difference here than to test whether I still could somewhere else.
