## Entry 0 - 2025-12-02

Fired the second batch of the celadon tea set today and the glaze came out exactly as Master Kwon taught me. Took one piece straight to Mother's room. She held it up to the window light the same way my father used to examine finished work.

**Nudge:** "What went through you when she did that?"

**Response:** It was just a nice moment. Anyway, the rest of the batch needs trimming before Thursday.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-05

Got an email from the Gyeonggi Cultural Foundation. They want to feature my work in a contemporary ceramics exhibition in Seoul next March. The catch is they want me to collaborate with a digital artist who projects animations onto pottery surfaces.

I said I would review the proposal. The money is good and the exposure would help, but the whole concept feels like it turns the pieces into screens. I keep rereading the email instead of answering it.

**Nudge:** "What would Master Kwon say about it?"

**Response:** He would probably say the clay does not need decoration it did not ask for. But he also told me once that celadon survived because potters adapted across dynasties. I do not know which version of his advice applies here.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-07

Spent Sunday at the Icheon Ceramics Festival committee meeting. They asked me to join the planning board for next year and I said yes immediately. My father served on that board for eleven years and his teacher before him. Sitting in that room felt like slotting into a space that was kept warm for me.

After the meeting a few of the younger potters invited me for soju. They were talking about selling through Instagram and shipping internationally, and I found myself actually listening instead of dismissing it. One of them, Minji, makes moon jars and photographs them beautifully. She said something about honoring the form while finding new eyes for it, which I have been turning over since.

It is strange how the committee meeting and the conversation afterward both felt right, even though they pull in different directions. The board is about preserving what we have. Minji's approach is about carrying it somewhere else. I suppose someone has to do both.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-12

Called my sister Eunji in Vancouver for her birthday. She asked if I would visit in the spring. I told her I would think about it, same thing I say every year.

**Nudge:** "What keeps the answer the same each year?"

**Response:** Someone needs to be here for Mother. And honestly, seeing Eunji's life there, her kids barely speaking Korean, the way she has just folded into something else entirely. It is easier to love her from here.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-18

A gallery owner from Gangnam visited today and suggested I could triple my prices if I made the pieces more "accessible." Smaller, simpler, pastel glazes. I smiled and showed him the door. My kiln is not a factory floor.

**Nudge:** "Did any part of his pitch land, even slightly?"

**Response:** The part about reaching more people, maybe. But not at the cost of making things I would be embarrassed to put my name on. There is a difference between sharing what you do and diluting it until it is unrecognizable.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-21

Mother mentioned at dinner that Eunji wants to hold a small Christmas gathering this year. She asked why we never do that here. I did not know what to say. We do Seollal and Chuseok. That has always been enough.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-23

Preparing the clay for the new year's first firing, which I always do in the last week of December. Same schedule my teacher kept, same schedule his teacher kept. There is something about the rhythm of it, wedging clay while the house smells like Mother's kimchi jjigae, the mountain visible through the workshop window still holding a little snow.

Minji sent me a photo of one of her moon jars displayed in a café in Itaewon. It looked beautiful, actually, warm light on white clay. I saved the photo. I would not do what she does but I am glad someone is doing it. The work keeps moving even if I stay in one place, and I think that is fine.

**Nudge:** "What made you save that photo?"

**Response:** It was a good photograph. The lighting was well done. Anyway, I need to finish wedging before it gets too cold in the workshop tonight.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-26

Eunji sent photos of her kids opening presents. My nephew was wearing a hanbok she had sewn herself. It was slightly wrong, the goreum tied on the left side. I almost texted her about it but stopped myself. At least she is trying.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from sending that text?"

**Response:** She would have felt bad, and it is Christmas over there. It does not matter. The kids looked happy.
