## Entry 0 - 2025-07-04

Third week of summer break and I'm already crawling out of my skin, spent the whole morning refreshing job boards for literally anything that isn't sitting at home, maybe I should just book a flight somewhere, anywhere, the walls are closing in.

**Nudge:** "What happened this morning that set this off?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-11

Principal Chen called about leading the new student orientation committee for August. I said yes before she finished explaining the scope.

**Nudge:** "You didn't even let her finish?"

**Response:** Honestly no. The moment she said "lead" I was already in. I've been rotting at home for three weeks with nothing to run, nothing to decide. My mom keeps asking why I don't just relax like a normal person during break. But sitting around feels like drowning. At least now I have something with my name on it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-13

I'm so frustrated I could scream. The orientation committee met today on Zoom and Ms. Liu, who's been at the school for fifteen years, kept interrupting me to "add context" every time I proposed something. Context! As if I don't know our own students. She literally said "Wei-Lin, you're still new here" in front of everyone when I suggested we move the welcome assembly outdoors to the courtyard.

It's my committee. Principal Chen asked ME to lead it. But every time I try to actually lead, someone older swoops in to remind me I'm twenty-three. I left banking so I wouldn't have to wait in line behind people who got there first. I thought teaching would be different.

**Nudge:** "Different how?"

**Response:** I thought... I don't know. That being good at something would be enough. At the bank I was fast, accurate, never made mistakes, but promotions went by seniority. I figured teaching would reward initiative—you put in the work, you earn the room. But maybe every institution is the same. Maybe I'm just chasing something that doesn't exist, some place where being capable matters more than being old. That's a depressing thought. I don't want to believe it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-13

Same day, different mood I guess. After that Zoom call and venting here I went for a long walk around the harbor, watched the fishing boats come in, and something clicked. Ms. Liu wasn't trying to undermine me—she's been running orientations since before I was in middle school myself, and she probably felt sidelined when Chen handed the lead role to someone who's been there less than two years.

That doesn't mean I was wrong to want to shake things up. The outdoor assembly IS a better idea. But maybe I came in too hot, treating the meeting like a presentation where I had all the answers instead of a collaboration where people needed to feel heard. My dad used to say I sprint before people have tied their shoes. He meant it as a flaw. I always took it as a compliment.

I think both can be true? I move fast because slow feels unbearable, but fast doesn't have to mean alone. I messaged Ms. Liu after the walk and asked if she wanted to grab boba tomorrow to talk through the logistics together. She sent back a smiley face. Small win. I'll take it.

The harbor smelled like diesel and salt and I took some good shots of the cranes against the sunset for the gram. Feeling more like myself now. Sometimes I just need to move to think.
