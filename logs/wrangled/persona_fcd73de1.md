He declined a department head position twice because it would require him to evaluate colleagues and potentially create conflict.

## Entry 0 - 2025-01-09

Parent-teacher conference season again. I spent the whole afternoon choosing the right words for each report card comment. Mrs. Tan's son is struggling but she takes any criticism of him personally, so I wrote that he "shows potential for growth with additional practice." Mr. Lim expects detailed feedback, so his daughter got a full paragraph. Different families need different approaches.

Colleague Mei Ling asked why I spend so much time on these when most parents barely read them. I didn't have a good answer for her. I suppose I just feel that if I'm going to put my name on something, it should be done properly. No parent should feel embarrassed or caught off guard at the conference.

New vice-principal wants to "shake things up" with the curriculum. Suggested we try project-based learning instead of structured lessons. Everyone at the meeting nodded along. I nodded too.

**Nudge:** "What were you thinking while you nodded?"

**Response:** That the current curriculum has worked for fifteen years. That students need structure and clear expectations. That project-based learning sounds good in theory but creates chaos in practice. But new vice-principals need to feel heard, and nobody else was going to say anything, so why should I be the one.

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-19

Something happened today that's been sitting with me. During lunch, a student named Darren made a crude joke in the canteen about another teacher, Mr. Goh. The other students laughed. Some teachers nearby pretended not to hear. I was walking past with my tray.

I should have said something. Mr. Goh is a good man, near retirement, a bit old-fashioned but dedicated. Darren's joke was disrespectful. But I kept walking. Sat down at my usual table, ate my noodles, graded papers during lunch like I always do.

The thing is, if I had confronted Darren in front of everyone, it would have become a scene. The other teachers would have had to acknowledge they heard it too. It would have been awkward for Mr. Goh if he found out. Darren's parents are influential in the school community and I don't want to deal with that. So I did nothing.

I keep telling myself it was the practical choice. But Mr. Goh was in the staff room later looking tired in that way that means something happened. Maybe he did hear. Maybe I should have been the one to defend him. I don't know why I'm still thinking about this.

**Nudge:** "What would have happened if you had said something?"

**Response:** Everyone would have looked at me. The other teachers who ignored it would have felt judged. Darren's parents might have complained. The vice-principal might have gotten involved. And for what? The joke was already made. Mr. Goh's feelings were already hurt. Nothing I could say would undo that. But I still feel like I failed some kind of test.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-22

Sunday. Called Mother at 7pm as usual. She asked about my health, about Mei's school results, about whether I'm eating properly. The same questions every week. I give the same answers. Mei is doing well. Yes I'm eating properly. Yes work is fine.

She mentioned that Cousin Huiying's son just got promoted to senior manager at some company. I said that's wonderful, congratulations to them. She waited a beat, the way she does when she wants me to say something else. I didn't say anything else. After we hung up I sat in the study for a while. The house was quiet, Ling had taken the kids to the mall. I thought about how I've been having the same conversation with my mother for thirty years. The questions change slightly but the shape of it stays the same. I ask nothing of her, she hints at things without saying them directly, we both pretend everything that needs to be said has been said. It's comfortable. Or at least it's familiar.
