## Entry 0 - 2025-04-29

Finished a long translation project today for that small organization documenting water access issues in South Asia. The pay was honestly below market rate but reading through those testimonies, I kept thinking about my grandmother's village where they still walk two kilometers for clean water. Some things matter more than what shows up in my bank account.

My cousin called from Mumbai asking why I don't take more corporate work since my English is good enough. I tried explaining but it felt like talking to a wall. She thinks I'm being foolish, giving away my skills to people who can't pay properly. Maybe she's right about the practical side. But when I close my laptop after a day like today, I feel something she probably wouldn't understand.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-05

The community garden is finally showing real growth. We planted those tomato seedlings with the Syrian family three weeks ago and today Amira brought her daughters to see the little green fruits forming. The oldest one, maybe seven years old, touched the leaves so gently like she was afraid of breaking something precious. I remember that feeling from when I first gardened with my mother on our tiny balcony.

These moments remind me why I spend my Saturdays here instead of picking up extra delivery shifts. Not everything needs a transaction attached to it. Though I'll admit the rent notice sitting on my kitchen counter is making that philosophy harder to hold onto this week. The landlord raised it again and I'm already stretched thin. Still, watching those girls discover where food actually comes from felt like enough today.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned the rent increase is making your philosophy 'harder to hold onto.' What happens when these two parts of your life feel like they're pulling against each other?"

**Response:** It terrifies me, honestly. I came here to build a different kind of life than the one that was mapped out for me in Mumbai, where everything is about climbing and earning and comparing. But now I lie awake some nights wondering if I'm just being naive. If my principles are a luxury I can't actually afford. My father used to say that ideals don't fill stomachs, and I hated hearing it, but lately his voice echoes louder. I don't want to become someone who stops caring about the bigger picture just to secure my own small corner. But I also can't keep pretending the practical doesn't matter.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-11

Something small happened during a delivery today that I can't stop thinking about. I was dropping off food at one of those new condo towers downtown, the kind with the marble lobby and the doorman who barely looks at you. The customer came down herself instead of asking me to leave it at the desk. She saw my reusable bag and we ended up talking for five minutes about plastic waste in the ocean. She works for an environmental law firm apparently.

It's easy to feel invisible doing delivery work, just a body moving packages from one place to another. But for those five minutes I was a person with thoughts and concerns that mattered to someone. She gave me her card and said they sometimes need Gujarati translators for community outreach. I probably won't follow up because I'm always hesitant to mix networking with genuine connection. But it reminded me that caring about the world isn't as rare as it sometimes feels. Other people are thinking about these things too.

**Nudge:** "You said you probably won't follow up because of mixing networking with genuine connection. What feels complicated about that?"

**Response:** I worry that if I reach out for work, it changes what that conversation was. It becomes transactional instead of just two people recognizing something shared. Maybe that's too precious about it. In Mumbai, everyone networks constantly and there's no shame in it. But I came here partly to escape that feeling of every relationship being measured by what it can do for you. If I contact her for the translation work, am I being practical or am I becoming the thing I was running from?

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-17

Read an article this morning about garment factory conditions in Bangladesh that ruined my whole day. I know I can't save everyone. I know my choices, even the careful ones about what I buy and who I work for, are drops in an ocean. But sometimes the weight of knowing what's happening out there feels unbearable. All these people suffering right now while I sit here with my morning chai worrying about my rent.

Called my mother after because I needed to hear her voice. She asked why I sounded sad and I couldn't explain. How do you tell someone that you're grieving for people you've never met, that reading about injustice thousands of kilometers away can sink your whole day? She would tell me to focus on my own life, that I can't carry the world. She means well. But the world is not something outside me that I can choose to put down. We're all connected, whether we see it or not.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-17

Evening now and I'm feeling better. Went back to the garden this afternoon and helped plant cucumber seedlings with Mr. Chen, the retired schoolteacher from the housing complex. He doesn't speak much English but we've developed a language through pointing and smiling and showing each other what to do next. There's something deeply right about working the soil with someone in complete silence.

I think this is what keeps me grounded when the news gets too heavy. Not fixing anything, not solving the big problems, just being present with another person doing something small and generative. The cucumbers will grow whether or not I read about suffering. The children will eat them. And somehow that feels like an answer, even if I can't quite articulate what question it's answering.

**Nudge:** "You said this feels like an answer to a question you can't articulate. If you tried to put that question into words, what might it sound like?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe I'm just being overly philosophical about putting seeds in dirt. Some things don't need to be analyzed, they just need to be done. My grandmother would say I think too much, that the hands should be busy while the mind rests. Perhaps she was wiser than all my searching.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-17

Third entry today, I know. But I wanted to capture this before I sleep. Amira, the Syrian mother from the garden, sent me a photo through our community group chat. It's her family eating dinner together, and on the table are tomatoes from our garden. Just regular tomatoes, slightly misshapen, nothing special. But the message she wrote said "Thank you for teaching us this. My daughters now understand that food is a gift."

Sometimes I question whether anything I do matters against the scale of problems in the world. The displacement, the inequality, the destruction of the planet. What difference does one small garden make? But then a photo arrives and I remember that we don't measure impact only in statistics. One family eating vegetables they grew themselves. One child learning that nurturing something is possible. These are not solutions to systemic problems, I know that. But maybe they're something else that also matters. I'm grateful tonight. Even with the uncertainty about rent and whether I'm living foolishly. This is the life I chose.
