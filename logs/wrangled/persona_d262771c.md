# Persona d262771c: Ricardo Mendoza Vargas

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** d262771c
- **Name:** Ricardo Mendoza Vargas
- **Age:** 55+
- **Profession:** Manager
- **Culture:** Latin American
- **Core Values:** Self-Direction
- **Bio:** Ricardo is a 58-year-old operations manager at a mid-sized manufacturing company in Guadalajara, Mexico. After twenty-five years in the industry, he built his reputation by developing his own inventory tracking system that upper management initially dismissed, only to adopt it company-wide three years later. He recently declined a promotion to regional director because it would have required relocating to Mexico City and following corporate headquarters' rigid protocols. His colleagues respect him for running his department his way, even when it means politely ignoring memos from HR about standardized procedures.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-23

Long day before the holiday break. The warehouse team finished the year-end audit using the tracking sheets I designed back in 2019 instead of the new corporate software. Takes half the time. Nobody from Mexico City noticed, or if they did, nobody said anything. Fine by me.

Gabriela brought tamales for the office. I stayed late to finish signing off on the last shipment reports myself rather than delegating to Arturo. He follows the manual too literally and I did not want to spend Christmas Eve fixing paperwork. Tired, but the numbers are right because I checked them the way I always check them.

**Nudge:** "What makes doing things your way worth the extra hours?"

**Response:** Worth it? Because when Arturo follows the manual, we get three calls from logistics asking why the codes do not match. Because I have seen what happens when people just follow what they are told without thinking. Twenty-five years and the company still uses my system because theirs does not work. That is what makes it worth it.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-30

End of the year, everyone talking about resolutions. Mine is the same as always, keep doing what works. The new director sent an email about "aligning regional processes" starting January. Another round of them telling us how to do our jobs. I already know how this goes. They fly in consultants, we sit through presentations, then we quietly go back to what actually functions.

Spent the morning reorganizing my office. Moved the filing cabinets to create more space for the whiteboard where I sketch out logistics problems. Nobody else uses whiteboards anymore, everything is supposed to be in the cloud, but I think better when I can see the whole picture drawn out in front of me. Marta teased me about being old-fashioned. Maybe. But old-fashioned works.

**Nudge:** "How do you usually navigate those alignment initiatives?"

**Response:** I listen carefully in the meetings. Take notes. Ask enough questions so they know I was paying attention. Then I look at what they want and figure out which parts actually apply to us and which parts were designed for an office in a different city with different problems. Usually about thirty percent is useful. I keep that thirty percent and let the rest fade. Nobody has complained because the numbers stay good.

## Entry 2 - 2026-01-06

First week back. The alignment initiative started with a video call. Regional wants us to adopt their scheduling software by February. I spent an hour after the call looking through it. The interface is cluttered and it does not account for the way our suppliers operate on different timelines than the northern facilities. Typical. One-size-fits-all approach from people who have never walked our warehouse floor.

I called Sergio in Monterrey. He has the same concerns. We agreed to document everything that does not work and present it together at the next regional meeting. Better to come with specifics than just complaints. I pulled data from the last two quarters showing our current scheduling method has a 94% on-time delivery rate. If their software improves that number, I will use it. If not, I have the data to explain why we are doing something different.

After work, I walked the floor with the night shift supervisor. He mentioned that two of the younger workers asked him why we do inventory counts differently than what they learned in training. I told him to explain that training teaches you the baseline, but experience teaches you the exceptions. Every warehouse is different. They will understand when they have been here longer.

Meeting did not go well. They want standardization regardless of the data. Something about "brand consistency across regions."

**Nudge:** "What bothers you most about this decision?"

**Response:** I put together the numbers. Sergio and I stayed late preparing the presentation. They listened, nodded, then said it was not about efficiency, it was about uniformity. My numbers did not matter. Twenty-five years building something that works and they want to replace it with something that looks good in a corporate report. I am tired of fighting the same fight.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-17

I started using their software this week. It is as bad as I thought. Took twice as long to schedule the Tuesday shipments because their system does not understand that our supplier in Colima closes early on Mondays and needs orders by Friday noon. Had to override the automated suggestions manually each time. The younger staff kept asking me how to work around the glitches.

What frustrates me is not the software itself. Tools can be learned. What frustrates me is that nobody asked us before deciding. Nobody walked into our facility and said, what do you need? They sat in their offices and drew up a plan and handed it down. I have run this department since before some of them were born. I know what works here. But they want compliance, not solutions.

**Nudge:** "What would being asked have meant to you?"
