## Entry 0 - 2025-04-11

Got back from the workshop an hour ago and I'm still thinking about the order we took this morning. A couple from Ghent wants a set of tiles for their renovated kitchen -- they want something "modern but with a nod to Flemish blue." I know exactly what Opa would do with it. I know exactly what I'd do with it too, and they're not the same thing.

I spent the afternoon sketching options. The ones that feel most like me don't really look like what the shop is known for. The ones that look like the shop feel like I'm just tracing someone else's hand. Maybe there's a middle ground but I haven't found it today.

**Nudge:** "What part of the shop's style feels most distant from your own?"

**Response:** It's less about the style and more about -- I don't know, I'll figure it out when I start painting.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-17

Finished the Ghent tile set. Went with a design that layers the old Delft patterning under more fluid brushwork -- sort of like the heritage is showing through underneath. Opa looked at them for a long time and then said "that's not bad." From him that's practically a standing ovation.

Choir rehearsal Wednesday went well. We're preparing pieces for the Ascension service in late May. Meneer Peeters gave me a small solo line in the Lassus motet which felt good. I've been singing these pieces since I was fourteen and there's something about the way the harmonies move that I can't get from any other kind of music. It's not about performing, it's about being part of something that's been going for hundreds of years.

Also got an email from a gallery in Brussels that saw my portfolio online. They want to talk about a group show in September. I should be thrilled but I feel weirdly hesitant, like showing the abstract work publicly might make it harder to keep one foot in the workshop world.

**Nudge:** "What would change at the workshop if the gallery show happened?"

**Response:** Probably nothing concrete, it's more a feeling. Let me think about it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-24

Long day at the church restoration. The plaster on the south wall is in worse shape than the diocese estimated so the timeline is blown. Came home and Opa asked when the next batch of souvenir tiles would be ready and I just didn't have it in me to answer.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-24

Writing again because I can't sleep. I know Opa wasn't trying to pressure me, he was just asking a normal question about the business. But it landed wrong. I'm stretched between the restoration job, the workshop orders, and now this Brussels thing, and I feel like everyone needs a piece of me that I haven't figured out yet.

My sister sent a photo of some mass-produced "Flemish style" coasters she saw at a tourist shop near the Markt. She thought it was funny. I didn't. That's what happens when the craft becomes just a product -- the hands behind it disappear. Maybe that's what bothers me about the gallery too, turning something personal into something on display for strangers to consume.

**Nudge:** "Tourist coasters and a Brussels gallery feel different from the outside. Do they feel different to you?"

**Response:** Yeah, I know they're different. The coasters erase the maker. The gallery at least credits you. I think what scares me is that once the work is out there, I can't control what it means to people.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-26

Workshop all day, filled six orders. Hands ache. Opa showed me a photo of his father working at the same bench in 1952 and I couldn't tell you what I felt exactly but it was a lot.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-27

Called the Brussels gallery back today. Told them I'm interested but need to see the space first before committing. The curator was friendly, said the theme is "inheritance and rupture" which is almost too on the nose for my situation. She asked if my work engages with craft heritage and I said yes before I'd really thought about whether that's how I want it framed.

After the call I went to Opa's room to tell him. He nodded and said something about how his uncle once turned down a commission from a department store because he didn't want to see the family name on something cheap. I think he was trying to tell me he understands being careful about where the work goes, in his own sideways way.

I keep waiting for someone to tell me it's fine to do both -- the workshop and the gallery, the old patterns and the new ones. Nobody's stopping me except maybe myself. But the art world wants you to pick a lane and the family just wants the shop to keep going, and I'm twenty-two and trying to hold all of it.

**Nudge:** "What would 'doing both' actually look like week to week?"

**Response:** I don't know yet. Maybe I'll figure it out after I see the gallery space.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-27

Second entry today because something small happened. Was cleaning brushes after the evening session and put on the Lassus recording from our choir rehearsal. Started humming my solo line and Opa came in and sat down in the corner chair without saying anything. He just listened for a while.

When the piece ended he told me my grandmother used to sing that same motet at Sint-Salvatorskathedraal before I was born. I'd never heard that before. It felt like finding a thread I didn't know was there, connecting her to me through the same music, the same stone walls.

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-30

Visited the Brussels gallery space today. It's beautiful -- high ceilings, raw concrete, very contemporary. Standing in it I felt like my workshop pieces would look out of place and my abstract work would look like it's pretending to be something it's not.

**Nudge:** "What would your work be pretending to be in that space?"

**Response:** Pretending to be detached from where it comes from, maybe. I don't know, it's hard to put into words.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-02

Church restoration is eating all my daylight hours. The diocese wants the south wall done before Ascension and the plaster situation means I'm basically re-doing the ground layer from scratch. My shoulders are wrecked and I keep getting home too late to work on my own pieces.

Had a thought while I was up on the scaffold today: the anonymous craftsmen who painted these murals five hundred years ago never worried about whether their work belonged in a gallery. They just made what the community needed. Part of me envies that clarity and part of me knows I'd suffocate in it. That's the whole problem, isn't it.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-06

Opa asked if I've decided about the Brussels show. I said I'm leaning yes. He said "good, your grandmother would have liked that." Didn't expect that at all.

**Nudge:** "You sounded surprised by his reaction. What were you expecting him to say?"

**Response:** I think I was expecting him to say the shop needs me here. Maybe I even wanted him to, so I'd have an excuse not to go. Hearing him connect it to Oma instead -- that knocked something loose.

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-11

Ascension service rehearsal today. Sang the Lassus and it went well but afterwards Meneer Peeters said the choir might switch to a more contemporary repertoire next season because attendance is dropping. A few of us pushed back, said the old music is the reason some of us are still here. He looked tired and said he'd think about it.

I don't understand why everything has to be either/or. Why does updating mean throwing out what came before? The whole conversation put me in a bad mood and I skipped the coffee hour after, which I never do. Mama will probably hear about that and ask what's wrong.

## Entry 11 - 2025-05-14

Finished the south wall restoration yesterday, just under the wire before Ascension. Stood back and looked at it for a long time. The colours are brighter now but the composition is the same one some painter laid down centuries ago. I added nothing of my own and that felt right for this particular work. There's a kind of discipline in faithful restoration that I'm starting to respect more than I used to.

Told the Brussels curator I'll do the show. I'm going to bring pieces that sit between the two worlds -- the layered tile work like the Ghent set, where the old patterning bleeds through into something new. Not pure abstraction, not pure heritage, but the conversation between them. She seemed genuinely interested.

Opa helped me crate the Ghent samples this evening. He wrapped each tile in newspaper the way he's done it for fifty years, slow and precise. Didn't say much. Didn't need to. I think he knows this is me trying to carry the thing forward, not away.

**Nudge:** "A month ago the gallery felt threatening. What shifted?"

**Response:** Opa's blessing, mostly. And finishing the church wall. I'll think about it more later.
