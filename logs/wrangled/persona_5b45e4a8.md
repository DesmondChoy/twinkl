# Persona 5b45e4a8: Priya Malhotra

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 5b45e4a8
- **Name:** Priya Malhotra
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Artist
- **Culture:** South Asian
- **Core Values:** Hedonism, Self-Direction
- **Bio:** Priya is a 22-year-old mixed media artist living in Mumbai, recently moved out of her parents' home to share a small flat with two other creatives near Kala Ghoda. She dropped out of a commerce degree after one semester when she realized she was only taking it to appease her father. Now she sells prints at local markets, does occasional commissioned murals, and teaches weekend art workshops to kids. She keeps irregular hours — painting through the night when inspiration hits, sleeping in past noon, spending long afternoons at cafes sketching strangers. Her mother still calls every few days asking when she'll "settle down with something stable." Priya has a collection of over forty house plants, splurges on good coffee and vinyl records, and refuses to take projects that feel creatively stifling even when money is tight.

## Entry 0 - 2025-11-01

Spent the whole morning at Leopold's working on sketches for the cafe mural commission. There's something about sitting in a busy space that helps ideas flow — all that ambient noise and people-watching. I ordered three cups of chai and didn't feel guilty about it. The sketches are coming together. Abstract florals with these hidden eyes peeking through petals. The cafe owner wanted "something colorful" which honestly gives me so much room to play.

I keep thinking about what Neha said last week, how she can't understand spending money on experiences when we're always behind on rent. But like... what's the point of hustling if you never actually enjoy anything? I'm not being irresponsible. I finished the commission brief. I just also let myself have a nice morning. Both things can be true.

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-08

Ma called again. The usual script. "Beta, you're 22 now. Meera aunty's daughter just got placed at Infosys. When are you going to think about your future?" I tried to explain that I AM thinking about my future, that the mural commission could lead to more work with the cafe chain, that I've been approached about teaching at an actual studio. But she doesn't hear any of that. She only hears "no salary, no benefits, no husband."

I hung up crying. Not because I doubt myself — I KNOW this is what I'm meant to do. But it's exhausting to constantly defend my choices to people who refuse to see them as valid. Papa at least stays quiet now. But Ma... she makes it sound like I'm throwing my life away for finger painting.

Rohan came over with biriyani and let me rant for an hour. He gets it — his family was the same way until he started making decent money from photography. He said something that stuck with me: "They'll come around when they see you're serious. You just have to outlast their doubt." But how long is that supposed to take? And why should I have to prove myself to people who should just... believe in me?

I painted until 3am. Angry brushstrokes that somehow turned into something beautiful. Maybe that's the only way I know how to process this.

**Nudge:** "That sounds really heavy — the gap between how you see your path and how your Ma sees it. What would it take for you to feel at peace with that gap, even if she never comes around?"

**Response:** Honestly? I don't know if I can feel at peace with it. Part of me still wants her approval even though I hate admitting that.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-13

Teaching day. Seven kids between ages 8-12, all hyped up on whatever sugar their parents gave them before drop-off. We did texture collages — fabric scraps, sandpaper, dried leaves. One kid, Advait, made this incredible piece with torn newspaper headlines layered under tissue paper. He said it was "all the boring words adults say, trapped under clouds." Eight years old. I was floored.

Sometimes I think about what I would've been like if someone had let me make weird art at that age instead of drilling multiplication tables into my skull. Maybe I'd be further along now. Maybe not. Hard to know. Anyway the studio paid me in cash and I bought myself fancy dark chocolate on the way home because why not, the day was good.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-20

Finished the Leopold mural. Owner loved it. He's already talking about his next location.

**Nudge:** "That's a big milestone — completing a commission and getting repeat interest. How did it feel standing back and looking at the finished piece?"

**Response:** Like I could breathe for the first time in weeks. That moment when you step back and it actually looks like what you imagined... there's nothing like it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-21

Ran into Vikram uncle at the market today — Papa's old colleague. He made this comment about how I should "use my artistic talents for graphic design, something practical." As if he knows anything about my career. As if I haven't already considered every possible path and deliberately chosen this one.

I know people mean well. I know they're just parroting the same fears their parents parroted to them. But I'm so tired of being treated like I haven't thought this through. I've thought about it more than any of them ever thought about their own safe little corporate jobs. I made a CHOICE. Why is that so hard to respect?

**Nudge:** "You've had a few encounters lately where you've had to defend your path. Do you notice this affecting how you feel about your work day-to-day, or does it stay separate?"

Three workshops back to back this weekend. Good money but I'm running on fumes. Need to protect my energy better.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-29

Had a rare quiet day. Slept in until noon, made myself a proper breakfast instead of grabbing biscuits, then just... existed. Watered all the plants. Put on a Norah Jones record. Sat by the window with my sketchbook and didn't force anything. Some days the best thing I can do is nothing at all.

I've been thinking about what success means to me. Society has this very narrow definition — salary, title, marriage, house. But when I imagine my ideal life, it's this: a studio of my own, enough commissions to stay comfortable, mornings where I can drink chai without rushing, the freedom to say no to projects that don't excite me. That's it. That's the whole dream.

People act like wanting to enjoy your life is lazy or lacking drive. But I think it takes more courage to opt out of the rat race than to join it. Anyone can chase money. Not everyone can figure out what actually makes them happy and then structure their life around it.

The mural money came through. I'm putting half toward rent and supplies, and the other half toward that weekend trip to Goa with Rohan and Meera. Non-negotiable. We need this.

**Nudge:** "That vision of success — studio, comfortable enough, mornings without rushing. What would have to change for that to feel within reach rather than aspirational?"

**Response:** Honestly it doesn't feel that far off. A few more consistent clients, maybe. Right now I'm just focused on the Goa trip.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-03

Back from Goa. Sand in places sand should not be. Sunburn on my shoulders. Zero regrets. We found this tiny beach shack that served the best fish curry I've ever had and we went back three nights in a row. Meera finally stopped stressing about her startup for five minutes. Rohan got some incredible sunset shots. I filled half a sketchbook with quick studies — fishing boats, palm shadows, the way light hits water.

This is what I work for. Not to accumulate stuff. Just to have these moments. To sit on a beach with people I love and think "this is exactly where I want to be." The work will always be there when I get back. But time with the people who matter, doing things that feel good — that's the whole point.
