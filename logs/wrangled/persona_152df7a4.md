## Entry 0 - 2025-02-12

Nothing really happened today worth writing about. Spent most of the morning in back-to-back syncs, the usual Monday chaos of catching up on what slipped over the weekend. Ate lunch at my desk again. Kimchi jjigae from the place downstairs, same order for probably the third week running. I keep meaning to try something different but I'm always too rushed to look at the menu properly.

Had a longer-than-expected call with our warehouse partner in Da Nang about the delayed shipment of syringes. Turned out to be a customs paperwork issue on their end. Nothing dramatic. I walked them through it, helped them resubmit. Could've passed it off to my team but I know that particular contact better and it just went faster to do it myself.

After work I sat on the bus home and watched people through the window for a while. Everyone with their faces in their phones. Some guy was asleep with his mouth open, briefcase sliding off his lap. I thought about how we all just do this every day, the same routes, the same tiredness, and nobody really sees each other. Not a depressing thought exactly, just a passing one. Cooked ramyeon at home, watched half an episode of something, fell asleep on the couch.

**Nudge:** "Why'd you handle the Da Nang call yourself instead of passing it off?"

**Response:** Honestly, Minh's been dealing with enough on his end. Felt wrong to make him explain the same issue to someone new on my team. It was just easier and faster.

Team meeting today, Director Kwon floated cutting two more rural routes because margins are too thin. I just sat there and nodded. Didn't say a word.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from pushing back?"

**Response:** I don't know. Wasn't the right moment, maybe.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-24

I keep circling back to something from this week. We had to choose between two packaging suppliers for the clinic kits. One is cheaper, faster turnaround, but their labor practices are questionable -- there were reports last year about conditions at their factories in Guangdong. The other costs about twelve percent more and would push our Q2 numbers into uncomfortable territory. I went with the cheaper one.

I told myself it was the responsible decision for the company. That keeping costs down means we can serve more routes, reach more clinics. And that's true, on paper. But I also know part of it is that I didn't want to have the fight with Kwon about the budget variance. The cheaper option was the path of least resistance, and I took it.

My mom would say I'm overthinking it. She'd say, "You can't fix everything, just do your job well." And she's probably right in a practical sense. But I keep seeing the article I read about those factory conditions. Young workers, long shifts, dormitory housing. I approved the PO this morning and then went to get coffee and stood in front of the machine for a full minute just staring at the buttons. I don't know what that was about.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-03

Dinner with some old consulting friends on Saturday. One of them, Sungmin, was going on about this new client of his, some fast fashion brand expanding into Vietnam. He was bragging about the margins they're projecting and how they found manufacturers who'd undercut everyone. I sat there eating my samgyeopsal and just let him talk. Didn't say anything. Didn't even raise an eyebrow.

It bothered me all weekend. Not because of Sungmin -- he's always been like that, it's his whole thing. What bothered me is I used to be the one who'd at least say something. Even a joke, something to signal that I thought it was messed up. This time I just chewed my food and changed the subject to football. I don't know when I became the guy who lets it slide.

**Nudge:** "When did you stop being that guy?"

**Response:** Maybe I never really was. Maybe I just liked thinking of myself that way. Easier to make a comment at dinner than to actually do something about it at work.

Spent Saturday morning with the cleanup crew along the river near Yeouido. Pulled out a shopping cart and about thirty plastic bags from one stretch. Didn't think about work the entire time.

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-14

I've been thinking about the annual vendor review coming up next month and I already know I'm going to let the Guangdong supplier pass without flagging the labor stuff. It's not that I don't care. I do. But raising it means a formal review process, means Kwon gets involved, means I have to justify the cost difference all over again, and last time I brought up anything remotely like this he looked at me like I was wasting his time. So I'll probably just sign off on the renewal and move on.

The thing is, I know exactly what the right thing to do is. Or at least what I think is right. It's not even ambiguous. But the gap between knowing and doing keeps getting wider and I can feel it. Like there's a version of me that would've already drafted the memo and cc'd everyone and not cared about the politics. And then there's the version of me that's sitting here at midnight writing about it in a journal instead.

Talked to my younger sister Eunji on the phone tonight. She's finishing her master's thesis on microplastics in Korean coastal waters. She was excited about some data she found. I listened and nodded and felt something like envy, which is a strange thing to feel toward your own sister. She just seems so clear about what matters to her and what she's willing to do about it.

**Nudge:** "What is it about Eunji that you're actually envying?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-16

Sunday. Woke up late, made doenjang-guk with leftover vegetables. Sat by the window eating and watching the pigeons on the building across the street. One of them kept trying to land on a ledge that was too narrow and sliding off, over and over. Kept at it though.

Went grocery shopping after. The ajumma at the market stall I always go to asked about my mom, which she does every time. I buy too many spring onions from her because I can never say no when she bundles in extras. Walked around Mapo for a while after, no real destination. Passed by the old bookstore on the corner and picked up a used copy of a Murakami novel I've already read twice. Something about the cover design on this edition was different and I liked it.

Called my mom in the evening. She was watching a cooking competition show and narrating the whole thing to me like I could see it. She does this. I mostly just listened. She asked if I'm eating properly and sleeping enough, the standard questions. I told her yes to both, which is half true. She told me my cousin Hyunwoo got promoted at his bank job and I said that's great. She didn't compare us, she never does, but I could hear her thinking about it. Or maybe that's just me projecting. Hard to tell sometimes.

**Nudge:** "Is the comparison coming from her or from you?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-21

Got the quarterly report today and the numbers tell a clear story. The rural routes we kept are operating at a loss, just like Kwon said they would. And the two routes he cut last month? The clinics on those routes are now getting supplies every six weeks instead of every two. I found that out from a field coordinator in the Philippines who emailed me directly asking what happened. I didn't have a good answer for her. I just said we were "restructuring delivery schedules" which is corporate for "we stopped caring."

I drafted a response about four times and deleted each one. The honest version would've been something like: I disagreed with this decision and didn't fight hard enough to stop it. But you can't send that in a work email. So I sent the sanitized version and closed my laptop and went for a walk.

Ended up at the river, not for cleanup, just to sit. It was cold and there weren't many people around. I watched the water for a while and thought about what Eunji said last week about her research -- how she said even small data points matter because they add up over time into something you can't ignore. I keep thinking about that in the context of my own work. Every route we cut, every supplier I don't flag, every meeting where I stay quiet -- those are data points too. They add up into something. I just haven't decided yet what that something is, or what I'm going to do about it.
