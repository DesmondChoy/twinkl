Payroll went through but the margin is getting thinner every month. The cotton shipment from the organic farm is delayed again - infrastructure issues, they say, which really means roads haven't been maintained since the last government fell apart.

Can't ask the women to take a pay cut. Most of them are sending money back to family in camps. But if this keeps up, I'll have to dip into the emergency fund by summer.

**Nudge:** "what does the emergency fund mean to you?"

**Response:** It's supposed to be six months of operating costs. But it's also the thing that lets me sleep at night knowing we won't collapse if one big order falls through or a supplier fails. Lately it feels more like borrowed time than a safety net.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-21

Meeting with the German retailer went sideways. They love the product but want us to scale production by 40% with the same turnaround time. When I explained our model - training, fair schedules, not running people into the ground - they got this polite smile that basically means "that's cute but not how business works."

Walking back to the car, I kept thinking about how easy it would be to just say yes. Hire faster, push harder, hit their numbers. That's what my father would do. That's what works.

**Nudge:** "that's what works - for what?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-21

Still thinking about the German meeting. Called my brother afterward and he said exactly what I knew he'd say - that I'm being stubborn, that growth is good, that the women would want more hours anyway. Maybe he's right. Maybe I'm the one holding everyone back by insisting on this slow, careful way of doing things.

But then I think about Rania, who's been with us since the beginning. She works four days a week because she needs Fridays to take her daughter to therapy. If we scale the way they want, that flexibility disappears. We become just another factory floor. And for what? So some Frankfurt boutique can hit their quarterly targets?

I don't know. Maybe there's a middle path I'm not seeing. Maybe I'm just tired and making this harder than it needs to be. But when I try to imagine us at that scale, all I see is the cooperative turning into the exact thing I left my family's business to get away from. People as inputs. Efficiency over everything else. I didn't burn those bridges to end up in the same place under a different name.

**Nudge:** "what would the middle path look like?"

**Response:** Honestly? No idea. Maybe that's the problem.

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-28

Spent the afternoon reviewing applications for the new positions. One woman had a PhD in literature from Damascus, worked at a university before everything collapsed. Now she's applying to sew hems. Kept staring at her CV, this whole other life just sitting there in 12-point font. Hired her obviously but couldn't stop thinking about it after she left.

There's something obscene about the randomness. She should be teaching. Someone else should be coordinating logistics in a factory. Instead it's all scrambled because of borders and bombs and bureaucracy, and here I am trying to patch together some tiny corner of dignified work while the scale of displacement just keeps growing. It never stops growing.

Sometimes I wonder if what we're doing even matters. Ten women, twenty, fifty - it's nothing compared to the millions stuck in limbo. A few jobs in Beirut don't fix anything. But then I think, what's the alternative? Give up because we can't solve everything? That seems worse. Though maybe it's just ego talking, convincing myself that this small thing is meaningful when really it's just... small.

**Nudge:** "a few jobs don't fix anything - so why keep going?"

Got the new dyeing equipment installed. Zero wastewater discharge, closed-loop system. Cost more than I wanted to spend but the old method was dumping chemicals into the municipal line, which ends up in the Med eventually.

The women were curious about how it worked so I did an impromptu walkthrough. Maha asked if other factories do this. Told her most don't because it's expensive. She just nodded, but there was this look - like she understood exactly what that meant and was disappointed but not surprised.

**Nudge:** "what did that look mean to you?"

**Response:** That most people choose the cheaper option. Same as always.

Another NGO folded. They were running skills training for displaced people in the Bekaa Valley. Funding dried up, just like that. Sixty people in limbo again.

**Nudge:** "did you know people there?"

**Response:** Two of our women came through that program. That's how they got the basic sewing skills before we trained them further. Makes you realize how fragile the whole chain is - one funding decision in Brussels or DC and the pipeline just stops. These systems we rely on aren't systems at all, they're just temporary arrangements that disappear when attention moves elsewhere.

Signed the lease renewal. Three more years in this space. Felt like a commitment, which I guess it is.

**Nudge:** "commitment to what exactly?"

**Response:** To the idea that this work can sustain itself. That we're not just a feel-good project that'll collapse when I run out of money or energy. Three years means I think we'll still be here, still employing people, still trying to do things differently. It's a bet that something better is actually possible, not just a temporary exception to how things usually work.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-18

Climate meeting at the municipality. Lots of talk about green initiatives and circular economy. Sat there listening to people describe the future they want to build and all I could think was - we're already doing this. We've been doing it for three years. Nobody in that room knew we existed.

There's this whole ecosystem of people trying to fix things - environmental collapse, displacement, economic exploitation - and we're all just scattered around, barely aware of each other, definitely not coordinated. Like trying to bail out a sinking ship with teaspoons while arguing about the most efficient bailing technique. Meanwhile the water keeps rising and the people with actual power to change things are having different conversations entirely, if they're paying attention at all.

Walked home along the Corniche afterward. The Mediterranean was flat and gray. Couldn't stop thinking about all the textile waste that ends up in there, the microplastics, the runoff from conventional dye houses up the coast. Our closed-loop system doesn't even make a dent in it. One clean factory in a sea of pollution. The metaphor is so obvious it's almost funny, except nothing about it is actually funny.

Maybe the whole approach is wrong. Maybe individual ethical businesses are just performative when the real problem is systemic - trade policy, regulation, enforcement, the economic structures that make exploitation profitable. But then what am I supposed to do, wait for governments to fix themselves? That seems even more hopeless.

**Nudge:** "which approach feels wrong?"

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-25

Had coffee with an old friend from university who works in finance now. He asked what I'm doing and I tried to explain the cooperative. Halfway through I could see him calculating the numbers in his head, figuring out that I'm probably making a quarter of what I could be making doing almost anything else.

He didn't say it but I know what he was thinking - that I'm wasting my education, my connections, my time on something that doesn't scale. And maybe from his perspective that's true. But I keep coming back to the fact that the women we employ have dignified work, can support their families, aren't being ground down by impossible quotas or unsafe conditions. That has to count for something, even if it doesn't show up in a pitch deck.

**Nudge:** "what does it count for if it doesn't scale?"

**Response:** It counts for their lives, right now, today. Rania's daughter is in therapy. Maha sends money to her parents in a camp in Jordan. Samar is saving to bring her sister over. Those are real outcomes for real people, not abstractions. Maybe that's not enough to change the world but it's enough to change their world. And if everyone who could do something like this actually did, instead of waiting for the perfect scalable solution, maybe we'd be less stuck.

Spring orders are coming in steady. Production schedule is full through May.
