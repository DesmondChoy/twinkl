- **Persona ID:** fb28552f
- **Name:** Margot Lindqvist

She has been married twice, both times to men she met while traveling, and currently lives alone in a converted farmhouse she bought on impulse three years ago. Her grown children joke that they need a map to keep track of her address, and her bookshelves are filled with half-finished language courses and trip itineraries for places she plans to visit next.

## Entry 0 - 2025-05-25

The end-of-year ceremony was today and I sat through three hours of speeches about commitment and building foundations and putting down roots. The headmaster went on about how teaching is about planting seeds and watching them grow over decades. Decades! I nearly laughed out loud. I've been here two years and already the walls feel like they're closing in. Same classroom, same view of the vineyard, same Tuesday staff meetings where Marie-Claire complains about the photocopier.

I know I'm supposed to feel grateful. The farmhouse is beautiful, the students are curious, the lavender fields smell like something from a perfume advertisement. But I keep thinking about that email from Kristina asking if I'd consider joining her school project in Kenya next spring. Teaching environmental science to kids who've never seen a glacier, helping build the curriculum from scratch. My heart raced just reading it.

Then I looked at my garden, the tomato plants I actually managed to keep alive this year, and felt this strange guilt. Like I'm betraying something by wanting to leave again. My daughter Elsa called last week and said, "Maman, don't you ever want to just... stay?" And I didn't know what to tell her because the honest answer is no. Not really. The staying is what makes me feel like I'm slowly turning to stone.

**Nudge:** "What is it about building something from scratch that gets to you?"

Booked the flight to Nairobi for a preliminary visit in August, told the school I'm taking a sabbatical to "explore professional development opportunities," which isn't exactly a lie. The tomatoes will be fine, Elsa will roll her eyes, and I'll deal with the farmhouse question later.

**Nudge:** "The farmhouse question?"

**Response:** It's just logistics. Whether to rent it out or have someone check on it while I'm gone. Nothing dramatic.
