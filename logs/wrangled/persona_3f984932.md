## Entry 0 - 2025-04-05

Finished the authentication module for the logistics client ahead of schedule. Took a different approach than what they spec'd out — used a token-based flow instead of the session model they wanted. Should be fine once I walk them through it on Monday.

**Nudge:** "What made you change the approach?"

**Response:** Their session model had a scaling problem they had not noticed yet. I flagged it in a comment two weeks ago but nobody responded, so I just built what would actually work. If they push back I have the benchmark numbers ready.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-12

Had a long call with my brother Faisal today. He has been at the same bank for twenty-two years now and just got promoted to department head. The whole family is celebrating. My mother called separately to tell me how proud she is of him, which — fine. He earned it. I am not bitter about that.

What got under my skin was when Faisal said, near the end of the call, something like "you should think about going back to a real company, you know, before it is too late." He did not mean it cruelly. He genuinely thinks he is helping. But the assumption underneath it — that what I do is somehow less real because I do not sit in an office with a title on my door — that has been following me around since I left the telecom job.

The thing is, I make roughly the same money he does. I pick my own projects. I took three weeks off last November without asking anyone for permission. I built a small open-source tool last year that people in four countries actually use. None of that registers as success in his framework, and honestly, it does not need to. I just wish the conversations did not always circle back to the same place.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for those conversations to stop bothering you?"

**Response:** Probably nothing they could do. I think the honest answer is that some part of me still measures myself by their yardstick even though I walked away from it. If I were fully settled about the path I chose, Faisal's comment would roll off. It mostly does. But "mostly" is not "completely" and that gap shows up at 11pm when I am lying in bed running the conversation back.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-15

The logistics client wants me to come on-site three days a week starting next month. Three days. In an office, at a desk they pick, on their schedule. Nadia says I should consider it because the contract is good but I feel like my chest is tightening just reading the email.

**Nudge:** "What part of the on-site request bothers you most?"

**Response:** The loss of control over my own hours. Right now I start when I want, break when I want, and structure my day around when my brain is actually working. Sitting in their office from 9 to 5 means pretending to be productive during the two hours after lunch when I am basically useless, and then having to leave at five when I am finally hitting a good rhythm. It is just a stupid way to work.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-16

Spent most of today going back and forth with the logistics client about the on-site requirement. Their project manager, a guy named Khaled, kept framing it as a "collaboration opportunity." I told him I have been collaborating fine over Zoom for six months. He said upper management wants to "see bodies in the building." That phrase — bodies in the building — is exactly why I left corporate work in the first place.

I offered a compromise: one day a week on-site, the rest remote. Khaled said he would take it up the chain but his tone suggested it was not going to fly. Part of me is already drafting a mental exit plan. I have two other clients and a lead on a new project through my old colleague Rami. The money would be tighter for a couple months but manageable.

Nadia thinks I am being rigid. She might be right. But there is a difference between being rigid and knowing what makes you actually function well. Every time I have forced myself into someone else's structure for long enough, the work gets worse, not better. I tried explaining that over dinner and she nodded but I could tell she was thinking about the school fees.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-18

Khaled came back with their answer: two days on-site minimum, non-negotiable. I told him I would need until Sunday to decide. In the meantime, I reached out to Rami about the new project — it is a fintech startup building a payments API. Smaller scope, fully remote, three-month engagement.

Ran the numbers tonight. If I drop the logistics contract and pick up Rami's project, I lose about fifteen percent of my monthly income for the next quarter. After that it evens out if the fintech extends. Not comfortable but not catastrophic either.

**Nudge:** "How are you feeling about the decision itself?"

**Response:** Fine, honestly. The math either works or it does not. I should probably focus on getting Rami to confirm the rate before I commit to anything.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-18

Cannot sleep. Keep thinking about whether I am making the smart move or the stubborn one. Nadia did not say anything tonight but she left the school fee spreadsheet open on the kitchen table, which said plenty.

**Nudge:** "Is Nadia's concern about money or something else?"

**Response:** Both, I think. The money is real — the kids' school is not cheap and we do not have a fat cushion right now. But underneath that, I think she worries that I will always choose the harder path when an easier one is right there. And she is probably not wrong. I just cannot make myself take the easier path when it means someone else deciding how I spend my days. That is not stubbornness, that is — I do not know what to call it. It is just how I am built.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-21

Turned down the logistics contract this morning. Told Khaled it was a good run and I appreciate the work but the on-site requirement does not fit how I operate. He was professional about it. Rami confirmed the fintech project at a slightly lower rate than I hoped, but I negotiated a performance bonus clause that could make up the difference.

Nadia and I talked properly last night, not the tense kitchen-table version but actually sitting down after the kids went to bed. I told her I know the numbers are tight and I am not dismissing that. She said she was not asking me to take the on-site deal — she just wanted me to be honest about the trade-offs instead of pretending it was a clean choice. Fair point. It is not a clean choice. I gave something up to keep something I need. That is the deal and I can sit with it.
