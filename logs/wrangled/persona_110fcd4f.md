- **Persona ID:** 110fcd4f
- **Name:** Lukas Bergmann
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Grad Student

- **Bio:** Lukas is a 23-year-old computational linguistics master's student at LMU Munich who chose the program over a safer corporate track his parents had mapped out. He tends to sit quietly through seminars even when he disagrees with the professor, then goes home and rewrites his entire thesis chapter his own way. He recently turned down a well-connected lab placement his advisor arranged because the research direction felt wrong, but hasn't told his family yet.

Sat through the whole lab meeting biting my tongue while Felix presented my preprocessing idea as his own. Didn't say anything. Walked home in the rain and honestly the cold felt better than sitting in that room. At least I know the idea works — that's mine regardless of who gets credit.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from speaking up?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-25

People keep asking why I turned down Professor Hecht's placement like I owe them an explanation. It was a bad fit. I don't need to justify building something from scratch when the alternative is tweaking someone else's framework for two years. My project, my call.

**Nudge:** "You sound sure, but you haven't told your family yet."

**Response:** Yeah, because telling them means a two-hour phone call where my mother explains how Professor Hecht's name on my CV would open doors. She's not wrong about that part. I just can't spend two years on work that doesn't feel like mine. I'll tell them once I have something to show for it — results shut down the lecture faster than arguments do.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-28

Three days into building my own pipeline and I'm already behind on coursework. Stayed up until four last night debugging tokenizer issues that would've been solved if I'd just used the lab's existing toolkit. My officemate Nina asked if I wanted help and I said no before I even thought about it. That was stupid. She's good at this stuff and she wasn't going to steal the project.

I keep doing this — refusing help because I need it to be entirely mine, and then drowning quietly. The fellowship application is due Friday and I haven't started the personal statement because every time I open it I think about how I'm supposed to frame myself as a team player. I don't know how to write that without it feeling like a lie, but I also don't know how to explain that I work better alone without sounding like a problem.
