## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Picked up a bubble tea order from Toa Payoh and the auntie at the shop asked if I ever get tired of riding around all day. Told her it beats sitting in an air-conditioned office watching my soul leak out through Excel spreadsheets. She laughed, said her son is trying to get her to hire a manager so she can rest. "Rest is for the dead," she said. I think about that sometimes—how some people need the motion, the doing, even when the body is telling them to stop.

Delivered to a condo in Newton. The guy who took the order was maybe mid-twenties, looked like he hadn't slept in days. Developer, probably. I remember that life—the midnight oil, the takeout containers stacking up. He tipped twenty bucks, which is rare. Made me wonder if he saw something in me, recognized the uniform of someone who opted out of the grind. Or maybe he was just too tired to count properly.

The thing about this work is you see everyone's lives in fragments. A birthday cake for a kid in Clementi. Medicine from a pharmacy to an elderly woman in Bedok who asked me to wait while she found exact change. Each delivery is a tiny window into something bigger. I don't know if I'm helping or just moving products around. Both, maybe. The city needs its circulatory system.

**Nudge:** "What do you mean by "opted out of the grind"?"

**Response:** Opted out is probably too clean a phrase for what happened. I didn't make some grand declaration. After the restructuring, I took a few weeks off, started driving for Grab "temporarily," and then the temporary turned permanent. The truth is I was scared to go back. Scared I'd slip back into caring about quarterly targets and performance reviews. Scared I'd become someone who measures his worth in promotions again. So I kept riding. Five years now. Priya says I'm running from something. Maybe she's right. But at least on the road, I'm running toward something too—even if I don't know what it is yet.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

Brother-in-law made a comment at family dinner about "still doing delivery." I told him not everyone needs a business card to feel important. He didn't say anything after that, but Priya gave me that look.

**Nudge:** "What was that look about?"

**Response:** The look that says I embarrassed her in front of her family again. That I could have just let it go instead of making things awkward. She's right, probably. But something in me couldn't let him sit there feeling superior. He sells insurance—half his job is convincing people to be afraid of the future. At least when I hand someone their food, they're genuinely happy to see me.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-14

Spent the morning at the shelter helping sort donations—winter clothes that people send even though we're in the tropics, which says something about how little attention donors pay but also something about the impulse to give, that even misguided giving is still a reaching-out. Ramesh was there, the Bangladeshi construction worker I've been teaching English to on Saturdays. His vocabulary is getting better. Today he said "bureaucracy" correctly and I felt stupidly proud.

Then back on the bike by 2pm for the dinner rush. The contrast is jarring sometimes—one moment you're sitting with men who send half their salary home to families they see once every two years, the next you're delivering premium sashimi to someone who complains the wasabi is on the wrong side of the box. I try not to judge. Everyone is fighting something. The sashimi guy might be going through a divorce for all I know. But still.

Route took me through Geylang. The old shophouses are getting demolished one by one. Another one gone since last month, replaced by scaffolding and a sign promising "luxury living." I don't know why I keep track. It's not like I can do anything about it. But someone should be witnessing it, I think. Someone should notice what we're losing.

Rain all day. Soaked through three times. App crashed twice during peak hours so I lost the surge pricing bonuses. I need to remember days like this when I romanticize "freedom from the cubicle."

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-20

Twelve-hour shift but hit my weekly target. Priya and I had dinner together for the first time in two weeks—she made fish curry, the Kerala style her mother taught her. Felt like us again.

**Nudge:** "What do you mean by "felt like us again"?"

**Response:** I mean we weren't performing. No tension underneath the conversation about money or my "career choices." Just two people who've been together fifteen years, eating fish curry, talking about nothing important. Her laugh came easy. Mine too. I forget sometimes that this is what I'm working for—not the money itself, but these moments. The ability to sit across from her without apology. To be present without calculating what I should be doing instead.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-29

Year-end party season means everyone wants everything delivered everywhere. Did a corporate gift run today—thirty identical gift baskets to thirty different addresses across the island. Whoever organized this clearly didn't think about the human being who'd have to actually execute it. By basket twenty-two, my back was screaming. Sat in a void deck in Tampines for ten minutes just breathing.

The weird thing is, I had this flash of missing my old job. Not the job itself, but the end-of-year bonuses. The company dinners at nice restaurants. The illusion of security. Priya's been hinting that her sister's husband (yes, the business card guy) might have a position opening at his agency. I said I'd think about it. I'm not sure if I said that to keep the peace or because part of me is actually considering it.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-01

New year. Priya wanted to watch the fireworks at Marina Bay but I couldn't face the crowds. We watched from the rooftop of our HDB instead, the view half-blocked by the neighboring tower. She fell asleep before midnight. I stayed up, counting the distant pops of light.

Made the usual resolutions in my head—save more, drink less, be more patient. But underneath all that, a different question kept surfacing: is this the life I want for another year? Not the delivery work specifically, but the uncertainty, the lack of a plan. I used to think planning was a trap. Now I'm wondering if having no plan is its own kind of trap. The kind where you wake up at fifty still "figuring things out."

**Nudge:** "What would having a plan even look like for you?"

**Response:** Honestly, I don't know. That's the problem, isn't it? Every time I try to picture a "plan," it looks like going backward—back to the office, back to the hierarchy, back to measuring life in KPIs. Maybe I just need to find a different kind of plan. One that doesn't feel like surrender.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-06

Someone on a riders' Telegram group posted an article about gig workers "lacking ambition." Had to stop myself from typing a rant. Ambition isn't one-size-fits-all—some of us just refuse to let corporations define what success looks like.

## Entry 8 - 2026-01-08

Priya finally said it out loud: she's scared. Not angry, not disappointed—scared. About what happens if I get injured, if the gig economy regulations change, if we never have enough for a real retirement. I wanted to argue, to list all the reasons this life is worth the risk. But looking at her face, I couldn't.

The thing is, I know she's not wrong. I've been telling myself that freedom is worth the instability, that I'm building something even if it doesn't look like what everyone else is building. But am I? Or am I just afraid of commitment dressed up as philosophy? The men at the shelter—they don't have the luxury of choosing instability. They're here because they have no choice. I'm here because I walked away from choices. There's a difference, and I'm not sure it's a flattering one.

Rode around Jurong West after we talked, just to clear my head. Ended up at a hawker center, eating prata and watching families come and go. A father helping his daughter with homework. An elderly couple sharing a plate of carrot cake. Ordinary scenes. The kind of life that requires showing up, day after day, even when it's boring. Especially when it's boring. Maybe that's its own kind of courage. Maybe I've been confusing restlessness with meaning.
