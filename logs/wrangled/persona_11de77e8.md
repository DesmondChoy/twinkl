## Entry 0 - 2025-08-23

Had the tech lead conversation with Martijn today. He laid out what the role would look like — running standups, making architecture calls, representing the team in cross-department meetings. I said I was interested, which is true, but the whole time I was thinking about how I'd actually handle it. I build things well when people leave me alone to think. That's not what this role is.

But I also know I did the right thing saying yes. Everyone on the team expects it, Noor would think I was insane to turn it down, and frankly it would look odd to pass on a promotion you're being handed. I can figure out the rest as I go. Probably.

**Nudge:** "What part of it actually interests you?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-30

Long week. Spent most of it pairing with the new hire, walking her through the codebase and our deployment pipeline. Didn't get to touch my own backlog at all but she's ramping up faster than the last person we onboarded so I'll take it.

**Nudge:** "Was it worth not having your own time?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-05

Sprint retro got a bit heated. Devika suggested we rethink the approval flow for deployments because she thinks it slows us down. She's right, technically — it does add a half-day lag. I had a whole alternative sketched in my head while she was talking, a lighter-weight check that would still catch the critical stuff.

Didn't say it though. The senior architects set up the current flow and they were in the call. Felt like bringing up a redesign right there would come across as me trying to show off, especially with the tech lead thing floating around. So I just nodded and said I could look into Devika's point offline. She seemed a bit deflated that nobody backed her up more directly. I get it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-10

Weird day. Started normal — coffee, standup, tickets. Then around lunch Pieter from platform team pinged me about a side project he's been hacking on, this internal tool for tracking deployment health across services. He wanted to know if I'd help build the backend. Not sanctioned work, just something he thinks would be useful and wants to pitch to leadership once it's built.

First thought was yes obviously, this is the kind of thing I actually want to spend time on, building something new without twelve layers of sign-off. Second thought was that Martijn would not love me spending cycles on an unsanctioned project right when he's evaluating me for lead. Third thought was that Pieter didn't ask anyone else, he asked me, and that felt good in a way I don't fully understand. Like someone saw the part of me that wants to just build.

I told Pieter I'd think about it over the weekend. Which is code for "I want to do it but I need to figure out if I'm allowed to want to do it." That sounds ridiculous written down. I'm a grown man deciding whether to write some code on the side. But it feels more loaded than that right now.

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-12

Told Pieter I'd help with the tool. We set up a repo and I spent an hour last night after Noor went to sleep scaffolding the API layer. Felt more engaged in that hour than I have all sprint on the actual work.

Today was back to normal though — reviewing PRs, answering Slack threads, sitting through a planning session where half the decisions had already been made before we walked in. The usual. I'm not complaining, it's fine. I just noticed the contrast, that's all.

**Nudge:** "You said it's fine twice now. Is it?"

**Response:** Yeah. It's work, it doesn't all have to be exciting.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-19

Noor and I went to dinner with her parents in Rotterdam on Saturday. Her dad asked about the promotion and I gave the standard answer — it's in progress, I'm grateful for the opportunity, etc. He seemed pleased. On the train back Noor said she was proud of me and I felt genuinely good about it. Like I'm on a track that makes sense to the people I care about.

Then on Sunday I stayed up way too late working on Pieter's tool and got completely absorbed refactoring the data ingestion layer. Noor asked what I was doing and I said "just work stuff" which wasn't really a lie but wasn't the whole truth either. I don't know why I didn't just explain it. Maybe because explaining it would mean admitting how much more alive that project makes me feel, and then someone might ask what that says about everything else.

**Nudge:** "What would it mean if you did explain it to her?"

**Response:** Probably nothing bad. She'd understand. I think the issue is more that saying it out loud makes it real — that the path everyone's excited about for me isn't the one that lights me up. And then I'd have to figure out what to do with that.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-26

Martijn officially put me on the lead shortlist. Two candidates, me and someone from the other squad. I thanked him and said I'd put my best foot forward. Which I will. Whatever doubts I have aren't anyone else's problem to carry.

---

## Entry 7 - 2025-10-02

Team drinks after work. Everyone was congratulating me about the shortlist like it's already decided. I kept saying it wasn't confirmed yet but nobody listens. Devika made a joke about me being her future boss and I laughed but it sat wrong with me for the rest of the evening.

I don't think I'm being fake about it. I genuinely want to do well, and the role comes with better pay, more visibility, things that matter. But there's this gap between how I talk about it to other people and what actually runs through my head at 11pm when I'm staring at Pieter's repo. Not sure what to do with that. For now I'm doing both, which is sustainable enough.

## Entry 8 - 2025-10-07

Presented the deployment health tool to Pieter's skip-level manager today. She liked it. Asked if we'd want to bring it under the platform roadmap officially. Said yes without hesitating.

**Nudge:** "That was quick for someone who usually thinks things over."

**Response:** Some things don't need overthinking.

## Entry 9 - 2025-10-11

Martijn pulled me aside after standup. Apparently someone mentioned to him that I've been spending time on Pieter's tool and he wanted to know if it was affecting my sprint commitments. It isn't — I've been keeping my velocity up — but the way he framed it made it sound like a warning. "Just want to make sure your priorities are clear," he said.

I told him it wouldn't be an issue and that the tool is now being folded into the platform roadmap anyway, so it's legitimate work. He nodded and dropped it. But I've been replaying the conversation all afternoon. The rational part of me knows he was just doing his job. The other part feels like I got caught doing something I wasn't supposed to enjoy. I hate that I felt the need to justify it. I hate more that I did justify it, immediately, without pushing back at all.

**Nudge:** "What would pushing back have looked like?"

**Response:** Saying something like "I'm delivering on everything you've asked, so what I do with my remaining time is my call." Which is true. But I keep imagining how that would land — confrontational, difficult, not a team player. So I default to the smooth version. And then I'm annoyed at myself for it later, which is its own kind of exhausting.

## Entry 10 - 2025-10-14

Got the tech lead offer. Accepted on the spot because that's what you do. Texted Noor and she sent about fifteen celebration emojis. Calling my parents tonight.

---

## Entry 11 - 2025-10-14

Same day, later. Parents were thrilled, mum teared up a little. Had a glass of wine with Noor and she kept saying she knew it would happen. Everyone's reaction confirmed that this was the right move, or at least the expected one, and those two things feel like they should be different but tonight they're the same and I'm too tired to untangle it.

I keep coming back to something small. When Martijn told me, my first feeling wasn't excitement. It was relief. Relief that it's done, that I don't have to hold the performance anymore, that I can stop wondering and just be in the role. Maybe excitement comes later. Or maybe relief is enough. I genuinely don't know and I'm going to stop thinking about it and go to bed.
