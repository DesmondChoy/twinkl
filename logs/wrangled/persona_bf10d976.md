## Entry 0 - 2025-02-16

Got an email from the procurement office in Mafraq saying they want to switch to a cheaper Chinese filter unit. Half the cost, sure, but the failure rate data I have seen from field tests in East Africa is not good. I started drafting a reply with the test results attached, then stopped. Because what if they just need to save money this quarter and I am the one being difficult.

Rania said at dinner that Noor needs new textbooks and the car registration is due. She did not say it as a complaint, just facts, and that somehow made it worse. I kept thinking about those filters in Mafraq and whether I am fighting the right fight or just being stubborn about something that is not mine to decide.

**Nudge:** "What makes it feel like stubbornness vs. the right call?"

**Response:** When it is the right call I feel steady about it. This time I keep second-guessing, which probably means I know the cheaper option might actually work fine and I just hate the idea of cutting corners on something that goes to people who cannot complain if it breaks.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-16

Cannot sleep. Went back to my laptop after everyone was in bed and found a message from Youssef, my old university friend who still works at the consultancy I left. He forwarded a job listing -- senior engineering director, Dubai office, salary that would cover both girls' tuition in one year. He wrote "just in case" with a smiley face. I know he means well.

The thing that got me was not the money. It was the simplicity. Show up, solve technical problems, go home. Nobody asking me to justify why clean water matters more than a lower unit cost. Nobody expecting me to write another grant narrative about "impact metrics" while families in Azraq are drinking from storage tanks that have not been serviced in months. I sat there staring at the listing for maybe twenty minutes.

Then I closed the tab. But I did not delete the email, and I am not sure what that means. Rania would not pressure me either way, but she would be relieved, and I can picture exactly how her shoulders would drop. That image keeps coming back. I feel like I chose this path and I keep choosing it, but tonight the choosing feels heavier than usual.

**Nudge:** "Why didn't you delete it?"

**Response:** Because part of me wanted to keep the option visible. Not to take it, probably. But to know it exists. Like proof that I could still walk away if this gets too hard. That sounds pathetic written down.

Drove out to the factory in Sahab this morning. Watched the team assemble thirty units in two hours, tested every seal myself. Loaded them into the truck for the Irbid delivery and the driver, Abu Faris, said his cousin's family has one of our filters and the kids stopped getting sick last winter.

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-27

Board call this afternoon, mostly routine. Layla from the Beirut office mentioned a school in Bekaa that wants to pilot our units in their water system. My mind wandered to whether we could scale the housing design to fit institutional pipes.

**Nudge:** "Did you bring up the school idea on the call?"

**Response:** No. I have learned not to pitch things until I have run the numbers. Last time I jumped ahead on a project in front of the board, the finance guy asked about margins and I had nothing. Embarrassing. Now I keep ideas to myself until they are bulletproof, which means some of them die quietly in my notebook.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-02

A report came out from an NGO I respect showing that three water projects in southern Jordan were suspended due to funding cuts. Three. Just gone. Families who were relying on those systems now have to go back to buying trucked water at five times the cost. I read it on my phone during Leila's basketball game and could not focus on the match after that.

It makes me furious in a way I cannot really explain to anyone at the game. The other parents are talking about weekend plans and I am sitting there doing math in my head about how many households that affects. Rania noticed and squeezed my hand but did not ask. She knows the look by now.

**Nudge:** "Does Rania ever say anything about the look?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-06

Met with a potential corporate sponsor today, a petrochemical company that wants to fund fifty filter units for a camp near Zarqa as part of their CSR portfolio. Good meeting on paper. They want their logo on the units, photos for their annual report, a "brand ambassador" visit where executives tour the camp.

I said yes to all of it because we need the money. Fifty units is fifty families with clean water, and that is not nothing. But I spent the drive back feeling uneasy. The camp is not a backdrop. The people there are not props for someone's sustainability page. I know how it works -- I have done these partnerships before and the water still gets delivered -- but every time I shake hands on one of these deals I lose a small piece of something.

Told Rania about it over tea and she said, "You always do this. You take the deal and then you punish yourself for taking it." She is probably right. I just wish there was a way to fund this work that did not require performing gratitude for people who are writing it off on their taxes.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-10

Noor asked me at dinner why we do not live in a bigger house like her friend Dina's family. She is fifteen and it was not a complaint, more like genuine curiosity. I told her we chose to put our money into the business. She asked what the business does exactly, and I realized I have never really sat down and explained it to her properly.

So I did. I told her about the filters, about the camps, about how water-borne illness is the thing that keeps kids out of school more than anything else in those communities. She listened, then asked, "But does it actually change anything or does it just help for a while?" I did not have a quick answer for that. It is the question I carry around constantly and hearing it from my daughter in her school uniform at our kitchen table hit differently than when it comes from a grant reviewer.

I said something about how helping for a while still matters. She shrugged and went to do homework. I sat there for a long time after. The honest answer is I do not know if what I am building will outlast the next funding cycle, and some nights that uncertainty feels like it is eating through the floor under me. But I also cannot imagine doing anything else, which maybe is its own kind of trap.

Long day at the factory fixing a seal press that jammed. Hands smell like silicone and my back is done. But we got the Zarqa order out on time and Abu Faris brought his wife's knafeh to share with the crew, which made the overtime feel less grim.

**Nudge:** "The Zarqa batch -- that the corporate sponsor one?"

**Response:** Yeah, that one. Fifty units, all sealed and loaded. Anyway the knafeh was really good, she puts extra cheese.

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-18

My brother Faisal called to tell me our cousin Samir just got promoted to VP at his bank in Riyadh. The way Faisal said it -- "Samir is doing very well" -- had that particular family tone that means "and what about you." I said congratulations and changed the subject but it sat with me the rest of the day.

I do not need validation from Faisal. He has never understood why I walked away from the consultancy and he is never going to. What I do know is that last week a mother in Irbid told our field coordinator that her son's eczema cleared up two months after we installed the filter. That is real. Samir's title is a line on a business card. I should not have to keep defending this to myself but apparently I still do.

**Nudge:** "If you don't need it, why's it still sitting with you?"

**Response:** Because somewhere in the back of my head there is still a version of me that measures success the way my family does. Cars, titles, where your kids go to school. I thought I outgrew that but it surfaces when I am tired or when someone like Faisal pokes at it. It passes. It just takes longer to pass than I would like.
