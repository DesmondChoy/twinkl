Twelve hours of back-to-back meetings today. Started at 7 AM with the operations team - had to override their shipping route recommendations because they were not thinking about the optics of our expansion into Saudi. If we enter through Jeddah instead of Riyadh, we look like a tier-two player. I need everyone to understand that perception matters as much as logistics costs.

Then two investor calls. The VC from Singapore kept pushing back on our burn rate, and I had to remind him that we are not some garage startup anymore - we have 85 employees and three office locations. I closed that conversation by walking him through our client roster. Names matter. He backed off after I mentioned the Emaar contract.

Spent the afternoon at a networking lunch with ministry officials. Exhausting but necessary. These relationships take years to build but can open doors overnight. One deputy minister mentioned a government digitization project coming up next quarter. I made sure to sit next to him, asked about his daughter's university applications - she is looking at LSE. I will send him the contact info for the alumnus I know on the admissions board.

By evening I was drained but still had to attend a founder's dinner. Could not skip it - three competitors were there and I need to know what they are hearing. Managed to learn that one of them is struggling with their series B. Good to know.

My driver dropped me home at midnight. My mother called while I was in the car, asking when I will visit. I promised next Eid. She sounded disappointed. I will send her something nice tomorrow - maybe arrange for her kitchen renovation she has been wanting.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned the range of relationships you're navigating - investors, officials, competitors, family. Which of these connections feel most like obligations versus ones that genuinely recharge you?"

Woke up still thinking about yesterday's question. Maybe I was too honest. Not everything has to recharge you - that is a luxury mindset.

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-19

Had an interesting situation today. My co-founder Youssef pushed back on my decision to hire a new Head of Sales from outside the company. He wanted to promote Hana, who has been with us since the beginning. I respect Youssef - he has been here since we were operating out of a serviced apartment - but he does not see what I see. Hana is good, but good is not enough for where we are going. The candidate from Careem has the network, the experience at scale. We need someone who walks into a room and commands it.

Youssef said I was not giving our people room to grow, that loyalty should count for something. Maybe he is right about loyalty. But I have seen too many startups fail because they let sentiment override strategy. I told him we would give Hana a significant role on the new hire's team and a retention bonus. He agreed, but the conversation left a bad taste. I do not like being seen as someone who does not value the people who built this with me. I do value them. I just cannot let that cloud the decisions that will determine whether we become a regional leader or another footnote.

**Nudge:** "It sounds like you found a solution that addressed both the strategic need and Youssef's concerns about loyalty. Navigating those competing considerations is not easy."
