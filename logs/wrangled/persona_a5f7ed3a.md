## Entry 0 - 2025-08-29

My cousin Luc called to tell me his wife is pregnant and they just closed on a house in Barrhaven. Good for them. I told him things are going well with the courier gigs and he got quiet in that way people do when they're trying not to say what they actually think.

**Nudge:** "What part of that silence bugged you most?"

**Response:** Probably that he didn't even bother arguing with me about it anymore. Like he's decided I'm a lost cause or something. A year ago he would've pushed back, told me to finish school. Now it's just quiet. I don't know if that's worse.

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-05

Picked up a double shift on the app Thursday because rent's due. Did about fourteen hours between rides and deliveries. Ate a shawarma in the car between pickups around Plateau. Phone died at 9pm so I had to call it early anyway. Made enough to cover rent plus a bit extra.

Maman texted asking if I'm coming to Tante Diane's birthday thing in October. It's in Sudbury obviously. I said I'd try. She sent back a thumbs up which from her basically means she already knows I won't make it. I'll probably go though. Diane's turning seventy and she's the one who taught me to skate.

**Nudge:** "What happens if you skip Diane's seventieth?"

**Response:** I'm not going to skip it. I just said I'd try.

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-11

Switched my Tuesday route to cover the McGill area because a couple of the regulars tip well over there. Figured out that if I stage near the Roddick Gates between 11:30 and 1 I can grab three or four lunch deliveries without killing my legs on the hills. Small optimization but it adds up over the week.

Called Grand-mère after my shift. She was watching her game show and half-listening but that's fine, that's how she is. Told her about the McGill route and she laughed and said her father used to deliver ice blocks on Sherbrooke Street with a horse cart. She tells me that every time. I don't mind hearing it again.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-18

Guy at a red light today rolled down his window and asked if I was hiring for my "company" because of the courier bag. Made me laugh. Told him it's just me and my bike. But it stuck with me after. I've been doing this almost two years now and I never once had to ask anyone's permission to take a day off or switch a route. That part still feels right even when the money doesn't.

There's something about the rhythm I've built here. Mornings I pick my own routes. Afternoons I can stop if I want to or push through. When I was in the business program in Sudbury every hour was accounted for by somebody else's schedule. I couldn't breathe in that. Maybe some people need that structure. I just know I'm not one of them.

**Nudge:** "When the money doesn't feel right, what does that actually look like?"

**Response:** It's not dramatic or anything. Just some weeks are tight. I figure it out.

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-25

Maman called tonight and it turned into a whole thing. She wants me to come home for Thanksgiving and also stay the extra week to help Uncle René move out of his apartment because his knees are bad. I said I can't do a week and a half off the app, I'll lose my momentum and the algorithm buries you if you go inactive. She hit me with the "family is more important than an app, Marcus" line and I kind of lost it.

I didn't yell or anything but I got sharp with her. Told her she doesn't understand how this works, that it's not like taking vacation days from a normal job, there's no paid leave, no one covers your shifts. She went quiet. I hate when I do that to her. She's not wrong that René needs help. I just can't be the one who drops everything every time. But saying that out loud to her felt awful.

**Nudge:** "You said she's not wrong. So who is?"

**Response:** Nobody's wrong, that's the problem. She's right that René needs the help and that family should show up. I'm right that I can't just vanish for ten days without it costing me real money I don't have a cushion for. It's just one of those things where both sides are true and somebody still ends up disappointed.
