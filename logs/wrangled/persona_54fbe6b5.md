## Entry 0 - 2025-08-02

- Finally shipped the offline-sync feature for the rural schools module
- Took three sprints longer than planned but it actually works on 2G now
- Ravi sir from the Hubli pilot sent a voice note saying the kids were using it during lunch breaks
- That voice note is doing more for me right now than any sprint review ever has

**Nudge:** "What was it about that voice note specifically?"

**Response:** He sounded surprised. Like he genuinely did not expect it to work. And the kids laughing in the background, just messing around with the app like it was a game. That gap between what we built and what they turned it into, I don't know, it reminded me of when Suresh sir first showed me a terminal in college.

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-07

Priya got her campus placement offer today. It is a decent product company in Hyderabad with good benefits. Amma cried at lunch, the happy kind, and then immediately started worrying about Priya living alone. I told her Priya would be fine. Honestly I am just relieved one less thing is on the table financially.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-07

Coming back to this because something has been sitting with me since the afternoon. When Priya showed me the offer letter I noticed the salary. It is nearly the same as mine, fresh out of college. I am not jealous of her, that is not it. She earned it completely. But it made me do the math I keep avoiding.

I have been at this startup for three years and the increments have been modest. The work is the most fulfilling thing I have done but I also know Amma's knees are getting worse and the consultation she needs is not cheap. Priya's new salary helps but she will have her own rent and expenses. I keep circling back to the same question without finishing the thought.

**Nudge:** "What's the question you keep not finishing?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-09

Had coffee with Nikhil today. He moved to a fintech company six months ago, says the work is mostly CRUD but the pay let him put his parents in a nicer flat. He was not bragging. He looked tired actually. I kept nodding and thinking about Amma's knee and the 2G kids in Hubli at the same time.

**Nudge:** "Can you have both or is that the problem?"

**Response:** I think the honest answer is I don't know yet and that scares me more than either option. If I leave for more money I know I'll resent sitting in standups about payment conversion funnels. But if Amma needs that surgery and I am still making idealistic-startup money, then what was all of it for? I keep framing it like a binary but maybe the part I can't say out loud is that I'm afraid whichever I pick I'll feel like I failed someone.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-09

Came back to write more because I could not sleep after that last entry. Nikhil also mentioned that his old manager from the gaming company reached out to me apparently. Said they are looking for someone to lead backend on an accessibility project, adaptive interfaces for visually impaired users. The pay would be significantly better than what I make now and the work would not feel empty the way pure fintech might.

But here is the thing. If I leave the startup, the offline-sync project does not have a clear owner. Karthik could take it over eventually but he joined four months ago and the codebase is, frankly, held together with duct tape and my institutional memory. The Hubli pilot is supposed to expand to three more districts by January. If that rollout stumbles because of a handoff gap, actual kids lose access.

I know I am not irreplaceable in some cosmic sense. People leave jobs and the world continues. But the timing feels like it matters. Priya's placement means I could take a risk on staying. Or it means I finally have the breathing room to go somewhere that pays properly. Same fact, two completely different stories depending on which direction I face. Lying here staring at the ceiling fan trying to figure out which story I actually believe.

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-12

Amma asked me at breakfast why I have been quiet lately. I said work stress, which is not a lie but is not the whole thing either. She said she hopes I am not overworking myself for her sake. The way she said it made me think she knows more than she lets on. That made my chest tight for the rest of the morning.

**Nudge:** "What do you think she actually knows?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-12

The Saturday bootcamp kids presented their projects today. One of them, Farah, built a bus-route finder for her neighborhood because her grandmother takes the wrong bus sometimes. It is buggy and the UI is rough but she demoed it to the group with so much confidence. I almost lost it in front of twelve teenagers.

**Nudge:** "What got to you about Farah's project?"

**Response:** She reminded me of why I started this in the first place. She was not building it for marks or a portfolio. She built it because her grandmother needed help and she figured out she had the skills to do something about it. That is the whole thing, right there. That is the part I keep forgetting when I am up at night running salary comparisons.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-12

- Got home from the bootcamp feeling good then opened LinkedIn and saw three more recruiter messages
- One of them literally said "stop leaving money on the table"
- Closed the app but the phrase is stuck in my head
- Maybe I should just turn off notifications for a while, I cannot think clearly with all this noise
