First real day of summer break. Slept until 10, made a proper French press coffee, and read on the porch for two hours. This is why I teach.

**Nudge:** "What do you mean when you say this is why you teach?"

**Response:** Honestly, I just meant the break is nice. Not everything needs to be deep. The coffee was good, the weather was perfect, and I didn't have to think about lesson plans. That's enough.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-26

Spent the week at a cabin in Wisconsin with Jenna. No cell service for five days. Best decision we've made in months.

**Nudge:** "What made the no-cell-service part particularly good for you?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-26

Got back from Wisconsin and immediately checked my email. Mistake. There's already an email from the department head about "optional" summer curriculum planning sessions. Optional in quotes because we all know how that goes. Last year three of us skipped the sessions and somehow ended up with the worst schedules in the fall.

I'm not doing it this year. I told Jenna I'm ignoring the email until August 1st at the earliest, and she actually applauded. Twelve years in and I've finally learned that the school will survive without me reworking the sophomore reading list in July. The people who show up to these things aren't more dedicated than me - they just haven't figured out how to protect their own time yet.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-02

Made paella from scratch today. Took four hours and cost more than ordering it from La Taberna, but there's something about the process that makes it worth it. Jenna said it was the best meal I've made this summer.

**Nudge:** "What is it about the process that makes it worth the extra time and money?"

**Response:** It's the ritual of it, I think. Standing over the stove, adjusting the heat, watching the rice absorb the broth. My brain actually turns off when I'm cooking something complicated. No thinking about September syllabi or parent emails. Just saffron and timing. The four hours weren't a cost - they were the point.
