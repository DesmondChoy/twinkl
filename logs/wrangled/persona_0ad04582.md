## Entry 0 - 2025-12-03

Spent most of the morning grinding ink and laying out rice paper for the lotus series. Got through three decent studies before Xiaoli called to say Ma was refusing to eat lunch again. Took the bus over and sat with her for an hour, spooning congee and telling her about the lotus paintings. She ate about half the bowl, which is better than yesterday.

Back at the studio by three. The light was already shifting but I managed to finish one piece I had been circling for weeks. Something about the afternoon angle gave the petals the translucency I wanted. Xiaoli texted to thank me for going over. She worries she cannot handle Ma alone during the weekday shifts at the restaurant, and honestly she is probably right. But today both things worked out: Ma ate, the painting came together.

Small day. But the kind where you go to bed feeling like you showed up where it counted.

**Nudge:** "What made today feel different from other days?"

**Response:** Different? I do not think it was so different. Maybe I just had enough energy for once. Anyway the lotus piece still needs another layer, so tomorrow is already planned.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-06

My daughter Yuwen called from Kaohsiung tonight. She has been offered a position in Singapore and she wants to take it. Two-year contract, some biotech firm. She was buzzing, talking fast the way she does when she has already made up her mind but wants me to say it is okay.

I said congratulations. I asked about the salary and the housing situation and whether she had looked into the health insurance. Normal questions. She said I sounded flat and I told her I was just tired from painting all day, which was half true. The other half is that Singapore is far and my chest got tight when she said January start date.

I do not think I am being unreasonable by needing a moment. She is thirty-four, she does not need my permission. But she called because she wanted something from me and I could not quite find it in the moment. I will call her back tomorrow when I have sorted myself out. People act like you should just immediately overflow with enthusiasm but sometimes you need to sit with the thing first.

**Nudge:** "What were you hoping to say to her?"

**Response:** That I am proud. That she should go. That I will be fine. All of which is true but none of which came out because I was too busy bracing for how quiet it will be once she is actually gone. Xiaoli has the restaurant, Ma has her routines, and Yuwen visits every other weekend. Without that I am just a woman alone in a studio talking to paper.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-06

Called Yuwen back this morning like I said I would. Told her Singapore sounds like a strong move and that I want to hear everything about the lab once she has her first week under her belt. She sounded relieved. I could hear it in the way her voice loosened up.

After we hung up I went to the studio and started a new piece, something looser than the lotus series. Just playing with ink density on wet paper, watching the way it bleeds outward. No plan, no composition sketch. It has been months since I painted without a destination in mind and it felt like stretching a muscle I had forgotten about.

Dropped off steamed buns at Xiaoli's restaurant around noon. The lunch crowd was thin so we actually sat and ate together for twenty minutes. She asked about Yuwen and I told her. She squeezed my arm and said she is not going anywhere. I know that. But it was good to hear.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-12

Had the calligraphy kids over today. Eight of them now, the youngest is six and keeps holding the brush like a pencil no matter how many times I adjust her grip. I should be more patient about it but something about watching her try so hard makes me want to get it right for her. I sat behind her and guided her hand through the first three strokes of her name. She laughed when the ink splattered and I let her keep the ruined sheet.

Their parents pick them up and sometimes linger to chat. Mrs. Huang brought tangerines for everyone and asked if I would consider teaching an adult class. I said I would think about it, but what I was really thinking about was how full the studio felt with eight small people breathing and concentrating in it. That kind of fullness is hard to manufacture.

**Nudge:** "What does that fullness give you?"

**Response:** Messy tables and ink on the floor, mostly. But I suppose a reason to set up and show up that is not just about finishing another painting for no one in particular. Anyway, Mrs. Huang's tangerines were excellent. I should ask her where she gets them.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-13

Gallery owner Mr. Tsai called again. Third time this year. He wants to include three of my pieces in a group show in Taichung next March. I would need to deliver the work in person and attend the opening weekend, which means two nights away.

I told him I would check my schedule and he said Meiling, you always say that. He is not wrong. I know the exposure would be good and Xiaoli keeps telling me I should put myself out there more. But Ma has her bad stretches and I cannot just hand that off. Xiaoli has the restaurant to run. I am not making excuses, I am describing the situation. Two days away means two days where nobody checks if Ma ate her congee.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for those two days to feel possible?"

**Response:** Probably just knowing someone would actually sit with Ma the way I do. Not just drop off food but sit there and talk to her and make sure she finishes. Xiaoli tries but she rushes. I do not blame her, the restaurant does not close itself. Maybe I could ask Mrs. Huang. Or maybe I am overcomplicating something that does not need to be this hard.

Ma fell this morning. Nothing broken, just a bruised hip. Xiaoli found her on the bathroom floor and called me in a panic. By the time I got there the paramedics had already checked her over and said to watch for swelling. We moved her to the couch and she complained the whole time that we were making a fuss.

Stayed with her until evening. Read her the newspaper, made her favorite sweet potato soup. She fell asleep around eight and I sat there watching her breathe for a while before Xiaoli came to take over for the night. I am tired in a way that has nothing to do with sleep. But she is okay. She is okay and that is the only thing that matters right now.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-19

Xiaoli called after midnight crying, saying she cannot keep doing this. I told her we will figure it out together. I do not know what that looks like yet but I meant it.

**Nudge:** "What does 'together' look like for you two?"

**Response:** I do not know, I just said that. Probably me doing more of the morning shifts with Ma so Xiaoli can open the restaurant without worrying. We have always sorted things out between us, this will not be different.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-22

Hired a part-time caregiver for Ma, three mornings a week. Her name is Ah-Fen, mid-forties, came recommended by Mrs. Huang's neighbor. Ma did not want a stranger in the house and told me so in Shanghainese so Ah-Fen would not understand. I told Ma to give it one week.

Ah-Fen brought her own apron and a thermos of ginger tea. She was gentle, did not talk too much, and knew how to help Ma to the bathroom without making her feel small. By the time I left, Ma was showing her the photo album from our old apartment in Shanghai. I drove to the studio and painted for four hours straight, the longest unbroken stretch in weeks. I am not sure if I feel relieved or guilty. Both, probably.

**Nudge:** "Where does the guilt come from?"

**Response:** From the same place it always comes from. Anyway, the important thing is Ma seemed comfortable with Ah-Fen by the end. If this works out, Xiaoli and I can both breathe a little.

Yuwen flew in from Kaohsiung to say goodbye before Singapore. She brought me a new set of Kolinsky brushes, the kind I would never buy myself. We sat in the studio and painted together for the first time since she was a teenager.

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-31

New Year's Eve. Xiaoli closed the restaurant early and we all ate together at Ma's place. Yuwen leaves on the third. I keep looking at her across the table and memorizing how she holds her chopsticks.

**Nudge:** "What are you holding onto?"

**Response:** The way things are right now, I think. Everyone at one table. Ma complaining about the fish being overcooked. Xiaoli laughing too loud. Yuwen sneaking rice to the neighbor's cat. I know this exact configuration will not happen again for a long time and I am trying to press it flat like a leaf in a book. I have spent my whole life making sure the people around me are okay and now one of them is leaving and I cannot follow. That is the deal. You raise them to go.

## Entry 10 - 2026-01-01

Woke up early, first day of the year. The studio was cold so I boiled water for tea and just stood there holding the cup until my hands warmed up. Started grinding ink out of habit more than intention. Then I began painting: a small sparrow on a bare branch. Not sure why. It just came.

Yuwen stopped by before noon to drop off a bag of groceries she bought for me. She organized my fridge, threw out three containers of expired things, and lectured me about eating properly when she is gone. She sounded exactly like my mother thirty years ago and I almost told her that but stopped myself because she would have rolled her eyes. I just said thank you and walked her to the scooter.

Mr. Tsai's show is in March. I told Ah-Fen she might need to do a full weekend. She said no problem. Xiaoli said she would check on Ma both evenings. Yuwen said she would video call Ma every Sunday from Singapore. Everyone just stepped in without me asking. I have been holding all the pieces so tightly and it turns out some of them can hold themselves. The sparrow painting is still wet on the table. Small thing, but I think it is good.

**Nudge:** "How does it feel to not be the one holding everything?"
