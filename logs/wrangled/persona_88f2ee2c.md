## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 88f2ee2c
- **Name:** Sander Hoekstra
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Gig Worker
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Benevolence
- **Bio:** Sander is a 39-year-old freelance bicycle courier and occasional handyman based in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He left a warehouse logistics job four years ago after his younger sister Lotte was diagnosed with MS, rearranging his schedule so he could drive her to appointments and help with her two kids when her energy crashes. He shares a ground-floor flat with his cat, Poes, and keeps a rotating cast of houseplants that he tends to with unreasonable devotion.

## Entry 0 - 2025-10-11

Picked up Lotte's kids from school again because she had a bad flare. Mats had a meltdown about his shoelaces in the car park and I spent ten minutes crouched on the tarmac retying them while Eva sat in the back seat reading like nothing was happening. That girl is ice. Bought them both stroopwafels from the bakker on Voorstraat and dropped them home. Lotte was on the sofa looking grey. I made her tea and put a load of washing on before she could say she'd do it herself.

Then I had to sprint across town for a delivery window I'd nearly forgotten about. Some law firm on the Maliebaan wanted documents by five and I made it with three minutes to spare, sweating through my jacket. The receptionist didn't look up. Forty minutes of cycling for eight euros fifty. That's the maths of it.

Got home, fed Poes, sat down, and realised I hadn't eaten since a cheese sandwich at eleven. My knee is doing that clicking thing again. I should stretch more. I should do a lot of things. The fern on the windowsill is browning at the tips, which probably means I've been overwatering. Even the plants aren't getting my best these days. Not complaining, just noticing how the day went.

**Nudge:** "What would complaining sound like?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-12

Sunday and I thought I'd have the morning to myself but Lotte rang at half seven because the downstairs tap was leaking and Pieter -- her ex -- isn't answering his phone as usual. Cycled over with a wrench and some thread tape. The washer was gone, ten-minute fix, but then she started crying at the kitchen table and I didn't know what to do so I just sat there. She said she's tired of asking me for things. That she feels like she's ruining my weekends. I told her that's stupid, she's not, but the word "stupid" came out too fast and she flinched.

I'm sitting on her front step now writing this. The kids are inside watching cartoons. I can hear Mats laughing. I want to go back in and say something better but I don't know what that would be. Sometimes being there isn't enough and you can't fix it with a wrench.

Later. Went back inside and Lotte had made coffee, which felt like her way of saying it was fine. We didn't talk about it. Played a board game with the kids -- Mats cheats spectacularly and Eva keeps a running tally of his crimes in a little notebook, which is both hilarious and slightly concerning. Normal afternoon. Good one, actually.

On the ride home I kept replaying the kitchen thing. She said "I feel like I'm ruining your weekends" and the truth is some weekends do feel like they disappear into errands for her. But I can't say that because it would confirm exactly what she's afraid of. So I carry it. It's not heavy most days. Today it's a bit heavy. Poes was waiting by the door when I got in, which helps more than a cat should.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-13

Had a full delivery day for once. Eight runs between nine and four, mostly parcels for that organic food box service. My legs are cooked but the earnings are decent -- sixty-two euros before the platform cut. One of the customers, an older woman near Griftpark, invited me in for coffee. I said no because I was behind schedule, then felt guilty about it for the next two hours. She looked lonely. I don't know why that stuck.

My mate Jeroen called and asked if I wanted to come to his birthday drinks on Friday. I said yes but I'm already calculating whether Lotte will need me with the kids that evening. Haven't asked her yet. I should just go. Jeroen always shows up for me. I just need to show up back. That should be simple but somehow it never is.

**Nudge:** "What makes showing up for Jeroen feel complicated?"

**Response:** It's not complicated. I'll go. Just need to sort out the logistics first.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-15

Lotte had a hospital appointment today. New neurologist, younger guy, very direct. He told her the progression is slow but real and that she should "plan her support network" for the next few years. She looked at me when he said that. Not at Pieter, who wasn't there. Not at our parents, who live in Friesland and visit twice a year. At me.

I sat in the corridor afterwards while she got dressed and I stared at a poster about hand hygiene and thought about what "the next few years" means. More school runs. More leaking taps. More weekends. That sounds terrible written down. I don't mean it that way. I mean I'm trying to understand the shape of what I'm signing up for, and whether it's something I'm choosing or something that's choosing me.

Rode home the long way through Amelisweerd. The trees are turning and the light through the leaves was that specific October gold that makes you slow down even if you don't want to. Stopped on the bridge over the Kromme Rijn for a few minutes. A heron was standing in the shallows looking patient. I don't feel patient. I feel like I'm holding something that keeps getting heavier and everyone assumes I'm fine because I keep showing up with the wrench.

**Nudge:** "You keep showing up. What would it look like to put the wrench down?"

**Response:** I don't know. Lotte has nobody else who shows up consistently. If I step back even a little, the gap isn't filled by someone else, it just stays empty. So putting it down doesn't feel like an option. It feels like leaving a hole.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-18

Went to Jeroen's birthday. Stayed three hours. Drank too many Jupilers, talked rubbish, laughed until my stomach hurt. He gave me a hug when I left and said he's glad I came. Lotte had texted to say the kids were fine at their dad's for once. I cycled home through the quiet streets feeling lighter than I have all week. Small thing. Good thing.

## Entry 6 - 2025-10-19

Mum called from Leeuwarden. Wanted to "check in" which always means she has something to say. She asked how Lotte was doing and I gave her the update from the neurologist. Long pause. Then she said maybe I'm "doing too much" and that it's "not sustainable." She suggested Lotte look into professional home care. I told her that costs money Lotte doesn't have. She said maybe I should focus on my own life, find a partner, think about what I want.

Right. What I want. As if I haven't thought about that. As if I'm some martyr running around Utrecht with a spanner because I haven't considered the alternative. I do think about it. I think about it on every solo ride home. But thinking about what I want doesn't change what Lotte needs, and nobody else is stepping in, least of all Mum who calls once a fortnight from three hours away.

I know she means well. I do. But there's something in the way she says it -- "focus on your own life" -- as if helping Lotte is separate from my life. It IS my life. She's my sister. Her kids call me Oom Sansen because Mats couldn't say Sander when he was two and it stuck. I'm not doing this out of obligation. I'm doing it because I'd rather be tired than be the kind of person who steps away when things get hard. That's not something I need advice about from someone who sends a card on birthdays.

**Nudge:** "What kind of tired are we talking about?"

**Response:** The kind where you wake up already behind. Not sleepy tired. More like the tank is always half-empty and everything costs a bit more than it should. I manage. But some mornings I sit on the edge of the bed for a while before I stand up.
