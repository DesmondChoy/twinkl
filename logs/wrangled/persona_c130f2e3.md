Got back from the studio late and Baba was already asleep but Mama was waiting up. She didn't say anything about me being late, she just set out the leftover kibbeh and sat across from me while I ate. The whole time I could feel her watching me and I knew she wanted to ask about the commission meeting. I told her it went fine, which it did, mostly. The client wants something for his hotel lobby, large scale, blues and golds, very safe. I said I'd do it.

But the thing is I'd spent the whole morning working on something else entirely, this series I've been sketching for months. Faces in crowds, people looking away from each other. Disconnection in tight spaces. It's the most honest work I've done in years and I can't show it to anyone. Not because it's bad but because every time I imagine hanging it somewhere or putting it in a show I can already hear my uncle asking why I'm painting something so depressing, or my cousin making that face she makes when she doesn't understand something but doesn't want to say so. So instead I took the hotel lobby job and told myself the other work can wait. It can always wait.

I keep doing this. The safe thing first, then the real thing never.

**Nudge:** "You said the real thing never happens. What would have to change for it to?"

**Response:** I'd need to stop caring what people think, which is basically asking me to be a different person. Or I'd need someone to tell me it's okay, which is pathetic at my age.

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-18

Friday lunch was the usual production. My aunt brought her friend who has a daughter studying dentistry and somehow the conversation kept circling back to me and whether I'm seeing anyone. Mama smiled the whole time and said nothing, which is her way of agreeing without being the one to push. I just sat there eating and deflecting. "I'm focused on work right now." "Inshallah, when the time is right." All the correct answers.

My sister pulled me aside after and said I handled it well, which felt more like pity than praise. She knows I've been seeing someone casually, someone who isn't from the community, and she knows I'll never bring it up at Friday lunch. Not because I'm ashamed but because I can already map out the exact sequence of reactions and it's exhausting to even think about. My father asking quiet questions. My mother suddenly having a headache. My uncle making a joke that isn't a joke.

People think I'm easygoing because I never push back. The truth is I've just gotten very efficient at predicting which battles aren't worth starting. That's not the same thing as being at peace with it.

**Nudge:** "You said that's not the same as being at peace. What does the gap feel like?"

**Response:** Like holding your breath in a room full of people who think you're breathing normally. It's fine until it isn't.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-24

Had a conversation with Rami at the studio today that's been sitting with me all evening. He got accepted into a group show in Beirut, contemporary stuff, political, boundary-pushing. They asked if I wanted to submit something too. I told him I'd think about it, which we both knew meant no.

He didn't push, which I appreciated, but later he said something offhand while cleaning his brushes. He said, "You're the most talented person I know who makes the least interesting work." He wasn't being cruel. He actually looked sad when he said it. I didn't know how to respond so I just laughed it off and changed the subject.

The thing is he's right. The hotel lobby commission is technically proficient and completely forgettable. The faces series sitting under the tarp in the corner of my studio is the best work I've ever done and no one has seen it. I keep telling myself I'm being strategic, building a reputation with the commercial work first, earning credibility. But at some point strategy becomes avoidance and I think I passed that line a while ago. I just don't know what to do about it because every option I can think of involves disappointing someone or drawing attention I'm not ready for.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-26

Long day finishing preliminary sketches for the hotel commission. The client wants revisions already, more warmth, more welcoming. I nodded through the whole meeting and made notes. On the drive home I realized I'd been clenching my jaw for hours and my neck is completely locked up.

Mama called to remind me about my cousin's engagement party this weekend. I said I'd be there. Of course I'll be there. Everyone will be there. I'll wear the right shirt, say the right things, congratulate the right people. I'm good at this part.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-31

Engagement party was fine. Loud. Lots of people I hadn't seen in months asking the usual things. How's the art going, meaning are you making money. Are you eating enough, meaning you look tired. When are you next, meaning why haven't you settled down. I smiled through all of it because that's what you do.

Danced with my mother at one point, which was actually nice. She was happy, genuinely, and I like seeing her like that. My father sat in the corner with the other men drinking coffee and nodding. He looked proud of my cousin. I wonder if he looks at me and feels something different, not disappointment exactly but maybe confusion. His son the painter. He's never said a negative word about it but he's also never asked to see my work. That silence says more than any criticism would.

After everyone left I helped stack chairs and my aunt squeezed my arm and told me I was such a good boy for always helping. I'm thirty-nine years old and I'm still being called a good boy. The worst part is I felt relieved by it. Like that's still the thing I'm chasing, the approval, the confirmation that I'm doing it right. Whatever "it" is.

**Nudge:** "You noticed feeling relieved at being called 'a good boy.' What does that tell you?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-04

Rami brought up the Beirut show again. He said the deadline was extended and there was still time to submit. I told him I appreciate him thinking of me but the timing doesn't work with the hotel commission. Which is technically true. But also I could find the time if I wanted to. I just don't want to deal with the aftermath of showing work that actually says something.

It's not cowardice. I know what it looks like from outside but it's more complicated than that. My family has a certain idea of what I do and who I am and disturbing that comes with a cost. Not a dramatic one, no one's going to disown me. It's subtler than that. It's the shift in how people look at you when you stop being predictable. I've seen it happen to other people and I've decided I'd rather keep things smooth. That's a choice, not a failure. At least that's what I keep telling myself.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-05

Can't sleep. Spent the last two hours looking at Rami's work online, the pieces he's submitting to Beirut. They're raw and unfinished-looking on purpose and there's this energy in them that I used to have. I pulled out the faces series from under the tarp and laid them out on the studio floor and just stood there staring at them. They're good. I know they're good. That's not ego, that's honest assessment after twenty years of doing this.

I took a photo of the pieces laid out and almost posted it. My thumb was literally on the button. Then I imagined my mother scrolling past it and asking why the faces look so lonely, or my uncle forwarding it with a comment about how art these days has no beauty. So I put my phone down and covered everything back up.

I keep thinking about what Rami said. The most talented person he knows who makes the least interesting work. It's like a splinter I can't get out. If I showed the real work and people responded to it, everything would change. But if people in my life reacted badly, that would also change everything. I don't trust myself to handle that without losing something I need. The approval, the ease, the feeling of fitting in. People act like fitting in is small but when you've built your entire life around it, it becomes the foundation. I'm terrified of what happens if I pull a brick out.

**Nudge:** "What would pulling that brick out actually look like, concretely?"

**Response:** Submitting to a show, probably. Or just leaving the tarp off the canvases when my family visits the studio. Small things. Anyway, I need to sleep.

## Entry 7 - 2025-09-07

Something shifted today, or maybe it's been shifting for a while and I only noticed now. I was working on the hotel commission, painting this massive blue gradient that's supposed to evoke the sea, and I caught myself adding tiny figures along the bottom edge. Almost invisible unless you're close. Faces turned away from each other, like my other series. I painted over them before anyone could see but for a few minutes they were there and the piece was better for it.

My sister came by the studio to drop off food Mama had made. She lingered, looking at canvases against the wall. She pointed at one of the commercial pieces and said, "This is pretty." Then she pointed at the corner where the faces series was partially visible under the tarp and said, "What's that one?" I told her it was nothing, just experiments. She said it looked interesting and I should show her sometime.

That's the thing about my sister. She asks without pushing. If I ever show the real work to anyone in my family, it'll start with her. Not because she'll necessarily understand it but because she won't make me feel wrong for having made it. That counts for more than most people realize.

I drove home feeling lighter than I have in weeks. Nothing has actually changed. I still didn't submit to Beirut. But someone in my family expressing even mild curiosity about the work I actually care about made me feel less like I'm carrying this alone.

## Entry 8 - 2025-09-13

Delivered the hotel commission today. Client was thrilled. Shook my hand and said it was exactly what he envisioned, which I think is the most depressing compliment I've ever received.

**Nudge:** "Why does hearing 'exactly what I envisioned' feel depressing to you?"

## Entry 9 - 2025-09-15

Took my sister up on her offer. Showed her three of the faces pieces at the studio today. She looked at them for a long time without saying anything. Then she said, "These are different." I waited for the follow-up, the concern, the suggestion to maybe not show Baba. Instead she said, "You should make more of these."

I didn't know what to do with that so I made us tea and we sat on the studio floor talking about other things. But the pieces stayed uncovered the whole time. I didn't put the tarp back until after she left. Small thing. But I noticed it.

**Nudge:** "You noticed you left the tarp off. What do you think that means for you?"

**Response:** Maybe I'm getting tired of hiding the work. Or maybe I just needed one person to see it and not flinch. Either way the tarp felt heavier putting it back on than it used to.
