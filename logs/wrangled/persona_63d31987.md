## Entry 0 - 2025-04-25

Supervisor meeting today. She said my literature review needs "tightening" before she'll sign off on the methods chapter. What does that even mean? I asked for specifics and got a vague hand gesture toward the citation list. Spent the rest of the afternoon comparing my draft to the review sections of papers that made it into top journals. They're all cleaner somehow, more confident in what they leave out.

Ingrid asked how it went when I got home. I said fine. She's been picking up extra client work to cover the gap our stipend leaves, and I couldn't bring myself to tell her I might be another month behind schedule. She looked tired. I should have said something real.

**Nudge:** "Why the 'fine'?"

**Response:** Because admitting I'm struggling feels like admitting I made the wrong choice. We gave up a good apartment, a pension plan, weekends that didn't involve reading deadlines. If I'm not making visible progress, what was all that sacrifice for?

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-28

Revised twenty-three pages of the literature review. Supervisor meeting rescheduled to next week because she's at a conference in Berlin. Department coffee hour was cancelled again due to low attendance.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-02

Grant application rejected. The feedback mentioned "insufficient preliminary data" and "unclear pathway to completion." I've been working on this for eighteen months. How much more preliminary can you get?

The younger students in my cohort seem unbothered by these setbacks. They shrug, submit elsewhere, go for beers. Maybe they haven't calculated their monthly burn rate. Maybe they're not watching their wife skip the organic vegetables at the supermarket because the regular ones are cheaper. I keep thinking about my old desk in Stockholm, the ergonomic chair the company provided, the predictable paychecks.

**Nudge:** "What makes the difference for them?"

**Response:** They can afford to fail. They're twenty-six, living in student housing, no one depending on them. I'm trying to build something at an age when most people have already built it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-08

Something small happened today that I keep thinking about. One of my students from the tutorial group, a first-year named Willem, stopped me after class to ask about the regression model I'd explained. He'd been confused during the lecture but didn't want to ask in front of everyone. I walked him through it again on the whiteboard, step by step, and watched his face shift from furrowed to open.

Teaching wasn't supposed to be the point. It's a requirement they attach to our funding, time carved out of research hours. But explaining something clearly enough that another person suddenly gets it, there's a satisfaction in that I hadn't expected. Reminded me of training junior analysts at my old firm, the ones who actually wanted to learn. I was good at that. People would request me for their onboarding.

Walked home the long way along the canal afterward. The light this time of year stays until past nine. For once I wasn't calculating anything. Just watched the boats and felt okay about being here.

**Nudge:** "What made today different from the grant rejection?"

**Response:** The grant was about me being judged. This was about someone else learning. I couldn't fail at helping Willem because there was no scoreboard. It was just useful or it wasn't.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-12

Couldn't sleep last night. Ran the numbers again on our savings. If I don't secure additional funding by September, we're looking at difficult choices. Ingrid doesn't know I've started browsing job postings in finance again. Not seriously, just looking. Just in case.

The thought of going back after everything we invested in this feels like a specific kind of defeat. Not just professional, something more personal. Like proof that I can't handle uncertainty, that I need someone else's structure to function. My father worked the same job for thirty-four years. I used to think that was limiting. Now I wonder if he just understood something I didn't.

**Nudge:** "What did your father understand?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe that wanting more than one thing at once is a recipe for misery.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-19

Department seminar today. One of the second-year students presented preliminary results that were, honestly, sloppy. Half the citations were missing page numbers, the statistical approach was questionable at best. But the professors smiled and nodded and said it was "promising early work."

When I presented six months ago, I got twenty minutes of pointed questions about my methodology. I spent three weeks revising based on their concerns. I'm not saying he didn't deserve encouragement, but the standards seem flexible in ways I don't understand. Maybe they see him as someone with time to improve. Maybe they see me as someone who should know better by now.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-19

Same day, later. Ingrid found the job postings in my browser history. I expected anger but she just sat down on the bed and asked if I wanted to talk. Told her everything. The grant rejection, the supervisor feedback, the runway calculations, the feeling that I'm competing against people who have nothing to lose.

She listened and then said something I hadn't considered. She said we came here so I could find out if I could do this, and that finding out includes the possibility that I can't, and that wouldn't make the choice wrong. It would just make it complete. I don't know if I agree with her logic, but hearing someone say it out loud made the weight feel different. Lighter, somehow. Like the worst case scenario has been acknowledged and we're still sitting here, still together, still figuring it out.
