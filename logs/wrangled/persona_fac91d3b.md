## Entry 0 - 2025-05-23

Signed Arjun up for the Math Olympiad prep course at Kumon even though his regular tuition teacher said he wasn't ready. The prep costs $480 a month on top of his existing classes and I didn't tell Ramesh yet. Not because he'd say no -- he never says no to anything for the kids -- but because I don't want to explain why I pushed for it. The tuition teacher was careful about it, said Arjun is solid but not exceptional, that maybe we should wait a year. And I heard myself saying he'll rise to the challenge, that's how we've always done it, throw him in and watch him swim.

But the car ride home was quiet. Arjun was in the backseat reading some manga and he didn't ask a single question about what just happened. He doesn't know I enrolled him. I was sitting at the traffic light near Bukit Timah and I thought, am I doing this for him or am I doing this because Kavitha aunty's son got into the Olympiad last year and I spent three months hearing about it at every family gathering. Priya brought it up at the temple too. Her Rohan this, her Rohan that.

I used to be the one people talked about. CA at twenty-three. First in the family to work at a Big Four. Now the only scoreboard I have is my children's report cards and I read them like they're my own performance reviews. Knowing something is off and stopping it are two very different things.

**Nudge:** "What happens when Arjun finds out?"

**Response:** He'll do what he always does. Nod, pick up the workbook, sit at the dining table after dinner. He's obedient like that. Sometimes I wish he'd push back so I'd have a reason to question whether I'm pushing too hard. But he just absorbs it, and I keep adding.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-26

Amma made pongal rice this morning without being asked. Just woke up early, did the tempering with the curry leaves and cashews the way she's done it for sixty years, and had it ready by the time the kids came down. Arjun ate three servings. Even Divya, who's been on some ridiculous diet she read about on TikTok, had a full plate. And for a moment the kitchen smelled exactly like my grandmother's house in Mylapore, that particular combination of ghee and mustard seeds and the brass vessels heating up.

I sat there and I was furious. Not at Amma. At myself. Because I can't make it taste the same. I've watched her a hundred times, written the recipe down twice, and mine is always missing something. She says it's the hand -- amma kai paakkum -- that the food knows who is cooking it. Which is the most unscientific thing anyone has ever said to me and also the truest thing I've heard in years.

She's seventy-eight. Her knees are bad and she can't stand for long anymore. She did this today because Arjun mentioned he missed her pongal rice last week and she heard him. She heard him and she got up at five in the morning for it. I need to learn it properly this time. Not from a recipe card. From standing next to her and doing it until my hands remember.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-29

Spent the whole morning reorganizing the prayer room shelf because Amma said the Lakshmi lamp was in the wrong position. Then drove Divya to violin, Arjun to Kumon, picked up Sanjay's cricket whites from the tailor. Calendar is a Tetris board this week.

**Nudge:** "Was moving the lamp just another task or something else?"

**Response:** It needed to be done. Amma asked, I did it. Not everything has to mean something.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-30

Ramesh asked why the credit card had a new recurring charge and I told him about Kumon. He just said okay, didn't even look up from his laptop. I don't know why I was bracing for a fight that was never going to happen. Maybe I wanted him to have an opinion about it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-04

Divya asked if she could skip the temple youth group meeting this Saturday for a friend's birthday party. I said no before I even thought about it. She went to her room and closed the door quietly, which was worse than slamming it.

**Nudge:** "Why was the quiet door worse?"

**Response:** Because slamming means she's angry and anger I can handle. Quiet means she's given up trying to negotiate. It means she already knows the answer before she asks and she's just going through the motions. I recognize it because I used to do the same thing with my own mother. Ask, get told no, retreat. I thought I'd be different but I'm running the same script.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-08

Pongal committee meeting at the community centre. Finalized the vendor list and stage layout. Kumaresh uncle questioned my budget for the second year in a row and I had the spreadsheet ready this time.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-10

Arjun's first Olympiad practice test came back. Forty-second percentile. His regular tuition teacher called to check in and I could hear the I-told-you-so in her voice even though she was perfectly polite about it.

**Nudge:** "What did you feel when you saw the score?"

**Response:** It's one test. Baseline. That's the whole point of a baseline -- you start somewhere.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-16

Long week. Sanjay had a cricket tournament in Jurong, two matches on Saturday and one Sunday morning. I was there for all of them, sitting in the pavilion with the other parents, making small talk about school rankings and enrichment classes. The usual tournament of its own, except we're the ones competing and the kids are just the scorecards.

Amma had a fall in the bathroom on Sunday while we were out. Nothing broken, but she bruised her hip and now she's moving even slower. Ramesh wants to talk about getting a helper but Amma won't hear of it. Says a stranger in the kitchen will disrupt the house. She means disrupt her routines -- the morning puja, the way she arranges the spice boxes, the specific order she hangs clothes on the bamboo poles. I understand it. I just don't know how much longer we can pretend she doesn't need help.

**Nudge:** "Where do you land on the helper question?"

**Response:** Stuck. I agree with Ramesh practically but I can't be the one who tells Amma her way of running a house isn't sustainable anymore. She built this life, this order. Taking it apart feels like telling her she's done. And she'll look at me like I've betrayed something. I'm not ready for that look.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-21

Divya played her violin recital piece for us after dinner and it was genuinely beautiful. Mendelssohn. She's been grinding at it for months and tonight she played it clean, start to finish, no stops. Sanjay actually put his phone down to listen. Amma was in her chair nodding along. Ramesh recorded the whole thing on his phone.

And when she finished I clapped and told her it was wonderful and she smiled -- real smile, not the one she uses to get through family photos -- and I felt my chest crack open a little. This girl who closes doors quietly and rolls her eyes at temple and fights me on every single thing she can. She stood there with the violin under her chin and she was radiant. I wanted to tell her that but I couldn't figure out how to say it without making it about her exam grade or her college application. So I just said "beautiful, kanna" and hoped it was enough.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-28

Arjun's Olympiad score went up to sixty-first percentile on the latest test. He showed me himself this time, brought the paper to the kitchen counter while I was chopping onions. I could tell he was pleased but trying not to make a big thing of it. I said good, keep going, and he nodded and went back to his room. Simple exchange but it sat with me.

I keep thinking about what my father used to say when I brought home my marks -- he'd scan the paper, circle whatever I got wrong, and say "next time, full marks." No praise for what I'd already done. Just the gap. I told myself I wouldn't do that to my kids but I catch myself doing a version of it. Keep going. As if where he is right now doesn't count. As if the sixty-one is just a waypoint to wherever I've decided he should end up. He looked happy at the counter. I should have said that's really good, Arjun. I should have let the moment be what it was.

**Nudge:** "Could you still tell him?"
