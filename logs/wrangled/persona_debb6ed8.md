The department meeting today went as expected. Principal wanted us to adopt the new digital assessment platform by January. Several younger teachers were enthusiastic, but I noticed Meera sitting silently, looking overwhelmed. She is only in her second year and already struggling with the curriculum changes from last term.

After the meeting, I walked with her to the staff room and showed her how to break down the transition into smaller steps. She seemed relieved. I did not mention this to anyone else because it might embarrass her. These small moments make me feel I am contributing something worthwhile, even if no one else notices.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-09

Amma's blood pressure was high again this morning. Cancelled my NGO session to take her to the clinic. Feeling stretched thin.

**Nudge:** "What's weighing on you most about today?"

**Response:** The children at the tutoring center were expecting me. I had promised to bring the geometry worksheets I prepared. Now another volunteer will have to scramble, and the children will wonder why I didn't come. At the same time, Amma needed me and there was no question about staying. But sitting in that clinic waiting room, I kept thinking about those children waiting too, and feeling like I was failing someone no matter what I chose.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-12

Staff lunch today, celebrating Lakshmi ma'am's retirement after thirty-five years. Everyone contributed dishes, told stories. The principal made a speech about her dedication. I sat there eating my rice and watching her accept a shawl and a plaque, thinking about how she spent three decades in the same building, teaching the same subject, attending the same festivals. She looked content.

My brother called afterward asking when I am planning to retire. His son is getting married next year and he wants to know if I can take extended leave to help with arrangements. I said I would see what is possible. The truth is I have not thought seriously about retirement. Teaching still feels meaningful most days, and I do not know what I would do with empty hours. But my brother sounded like he was already counting on my availability, and I did not want to disappoint him by saying I prefer to keep working.

There is also the question of my pension and whether the timing would be right. I have been careful with money but there are always uncertainties. Maybe I should start considering it more seriously. The conversation left me feeling unsettled in a way I cannot quite name.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned not wanting to disappoint your brother. What about what you want?"

Finished grading the Class 10 exams. Most students improved from last term. Ravi, who was failing in September, scored 72%.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-24

My colleague Anand said something today that I cannot stop thinking about. We were discussing the new reservation policy for faculty hiring, and he made a dismissive comment about how it lowers standards. I disagreed but only said "these policies have complex reasons" and changed the subject to exam schedules.

Later I felt angry at myself. I have taught students from every background for nearly three decades and I know that talent is not distributed by birth. But I did not say any of this to Anand. I worried about creating an awkward atmosphere in the department. Now I am sitting here wondering if my silence made it seem like I agreed. The children I tutor on weekends would not recognize this version of me, the one who says nothing when it matters.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned the children wouldn't recognize this version of you. Which version feels more like the real one?"

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-03

New year, same routines. I find comfort in this. The school reopened today and there is something settling about walking through the gates, hearing the morning assembly, smelling chalk and floor cleaner.

I brought sweets for the staff room, as I do every January. Small gestures maintain the fabric of a workplace. I noticed the new Hindi teacher, Priya, looking uncertain during break time. I invited her to sit with our group. She seemed grateful. I remember how difficult my first year was, how much it mattered when senior teachers acknowledged me. If I can make someone's path a little easier, that feels like enough.

**Nudge:** "What do you remember most about that first year?"

**Response:** I remember feeling like a fraud. I had my qualifications, my training, but standing in front of a classroom full of fourteen-year-olds who could sense every hesitation, I felt exposed. There was one day, maybe three months in, when a student asked me a question I could not answer. I panicked, gave some vague response, and spent the whole night convinced everyone knew I was not qualified to be there.

What saved me was Mrs. Subramanian, who taught physics. She never made a fuss, just started including me in her lunch conversations, asking my opinion on small matters, treating me like I belonged. I never told her how much that meant. She passed away six years ago. I suppose I keep doing for others what she did for me, hoping it matters the way it mattered to me.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-10

My sister-in-law visited today and made a comment about how I spend too much time on "outside activities" instead of focusing on the family. She was referring to the NGO work. I explained calmly that I only go twice a month and always ensure Amma is cared for. She nodded but I could see she was not convinced.

I should not have to justify myself. I have managed this household for fifteen years while working full-time. I have never once complained about cooking for her when she visits or adjusting my schedule around her preferences. The tutoring gives me purpose beyond daily obligations. But I did not say any of this. I just served tea and changed the subject to her daughter's college applications.

**Nudge:** "What does that purpose feel like when you're there with the children?"

**Response:** It feels like my skills matter beyond grades and syllabi. These children, most of them are first-generation learners. Their parents work long hours in construction or domestic help. When I explain a concept and I see understanding appear on a face that was confused a moment before, it is the same satisfaction I felt in my first years of teaching, before it became routine.

At school, I am Padmini ma'am, the department head who files reports and attends meetings. At the tutoring center, I am just someone who knows something useful and is willing to share it. The children do not care about my title or my seniority. They only care that I showed up and that I can help them understand fractions. It is simpler and somehow more honest.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-18

Reading the news this morning about the air quality crisis in Delhi. Schools closed, children wearing masks, hospitals filled with respiratory cases. I kept thinking about the children there who have no choice but to breathe that air, whose families cannot afford air purifiers or trips to cleaner places.

We complain about Chennai traffic and summer heat, but this is different. This is a slow catastrophe that everyone sees but no one seems able to stop. The article mentioned that the poorest neighborhoods have the worst air quality because they are near industrial zones. Of course they do. It is always the same pattern, those with the least resources bearing the heaviest burdens.

I mentioned this to a colleague during lunch and she shrugged, said "what can we do, these things are beyond us." I understand the impulse. The scale of the problem makes individual action feel pointless. But I kept thinking about it through my afternoon classes. The students I teach will inherit this world. What am I preparing them for, if not to care about things larger than their exam scores?

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to prepare them to care about things larger than exams?"

**Response:** That is the question, isn't it. I am not sure I have an answer. The syllabus is the syllabus, the exams are the exams. But sometimes I try to use real examples in my word problems. Calculating pollution levels, or ratios of resources. Small things. Maybe it plants a seed, maybe it does not. I cannot solve the crisis but I can teach the children who might.

## Entry 8 - 2026-01-24

Difficult day at the tutoring center. One of the regular students, Kavitha, did not come. I asked around and learned her family is moving back to their village because her father lost his job. She is twelve and had been making such progress in mathematics. Now she will attend the government school there, which may not have the same resources.

I keep thinking about all the Kavithas, the children whose potential depends on circumstances they did not choose. I can help a few, a handful each year, but there are so many more. The NGO coordinator asked if I could take on additional sessions. I said I would think about it, but I already know my family obligations make this difficult. Amma needs more care as she gets older, my brother's wedding preparations are starting, and I cannot ask others to carry my responsibilities so I can spend more time elsewhere. But it sits heavily, knowing there are children who need help and I am not able to give it.

**Nudge:** "What would it feel like to say yes to those additional sessions?"

**Response:** It would feel like choosing. And I have spent my whole life arranging things so I do not have to choose, so everyone gets enough of me, even if no one gets all of me. If I said yes to more sessions, I would have to say no to something else, and then I would have to explain that no, and see the disappointment, and feel like I am being selfish.

The strange thing is, I know I am not selfish. I have given and given for decades. But somehow the idea of asking for something, of prioritizing what feeds my soul over what is expected, still feels like a transgression. Kavitha's face keeps appearing in my mind. I cannot save her from moving away, but maybe I could have helped more children like her if I had been braver about asking for time that was truly mine.
