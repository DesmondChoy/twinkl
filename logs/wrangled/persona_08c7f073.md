## Entry 0 - 2025-10-07

Started prepping canvases for the November show this morning. Same dimensions I always use for the parish hall walls -- 80 by 120, because the hooks are fixed in place and nobody is going to drill new ones into century-old plaster. There's something steadying about knowing exactly where each piece will hang before I've even mixed a color.

Spent the afternoon sketching from the bridge near Engis. The light this time of year turns the river into something between pewter and bronze, and I keep trying to pin it down the way Grand-mere did in her later work. I'm not sure I've gotten it right yet. Maybe I never will, but the attempt itself feels like the point. Brought the kids after school and let them toss stones while I worked. Ordinary afternoon.

**Nudge:** "What does getting it 'right' mean to you here?"

**Response:** Probably less about the painting and more about the river itself.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-10

Parish hall booking confirmed for November 15-16. Same weekend as last year. Father Renaud said they're replacing the radiators in the vestibule, but the main hall should be unaffected. Spoke with Maman about the catering -- she'll do the tarte al djote again and Tante Sylvie offered to bring the boulets. This is the seventh year running we've kept to the same menu.

The framer in Jupille finished mounting three pieces. I went to collect them and he'd used the same molding profile Grand-mere specified in her notebook -- simple oak, no gilding. I didn't ask him to match it; he just remembered from previous years. Small thing, but it matters. There's a continuity in those details that makes the whole event feel less like something I organize and more like something that carries itself forward.

Spent the evening sorting through old catalogues from Maman's early exhibitions. Found a small pencil sketch she'd tucked inside the 1988 programme -- a quick study of the church door. I might frame it and include it in my show as a kind of anchor piece. Not sure yet. Need to ask her first.

**Nudge:** "Why does asking her first feel necessary?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-12

A gallerist from Brussels came by the studio yesterday. She'd seen some photos online and wanted to know if I'd be interested in showing at her space in Ixelles. Bigger audience, better lighting, actual opening night press. She said the parish hall thing was "charming" but suggested I was limiting my reach.

I know she meant it as a compliment, or at least as professional advice. But I didn't ask for professional advice. The November show isn't about reach. It's about the fact that people from the neighborhood come back each year and some of them remember Grand-mere's work on those same walls. That means something that a Brussels gallery opening with wine and small talk cannot replicate. I told her I'd think about it, but I already know the answer.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-17

My daughter asked why we always have to go to Papy and Mamy's on Sundays. She wants to do football practice with her friends instead. I didn't have a good answer -- just that we go because we've always gone. Hearing it out loud, it sounded hollow even to me.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-17

Still turning over what Elise said this morning. She's nine. She doesn't understand yet why we keep these rhythms, and I shouldn't expect her to. But the question caught me off guard because I've never had to justify it before. To anyone. Not even to myself.

My partner mentioned, gently, that maybe the Sunday lunches could shift to every other week. That the kids are getting older and their schedules are filling up. He wasn't attacking anything -- he was being practical. But it felt like the start of something eroding. If we skip one week, then two, then the meal becomes a monthly obligation that people rearrange their calendars around rather than something that simply is.

I know that's not rational. Things have to bend sometimes. I just don't want to be the one who let them break. Three generations of Sunday lunches in that kitchen. My grandfather built the long table specifically because he wanted everyone to sit together. It wasn't incidental. It was a decision, and decisions like that deserve to be honored even when they stop being convenient.

**Nudge:** "What would 'letting them break' actually look like?"

**Response:** Empty chairs. The table feeling too big. Maman cooking for two instead of twelve.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-20

Went to the studio early. Needed to just paint without thinking about schedules or compromises. Worked on the largest canvas for the show -- the one based on the view from the mill bridge. It's the same view Grand-mere painted in 1971, and Maman in 1994, and now me. Three versions of the same bend in the river, each a little different because the trees change and the banks shift, but the bones of it stay.

A friend who paints digitally told me last week that I should try working on a tablet. Faster, cheaper, infinite undo. I told him I like the smell of linseed oil and the resistance of the canvas. He laughed like I was joking. I wasn't. The materials matter. The process matters. You don't inherit a craft by switching to whatever's newest. You inherit it by keeping your hands in the same medium.

**Nudge:** "Is it the craft you're keeping, or something else?"

**Response:** Both. The craft and the line of people who practiced it before me.

## Entry 6 - 2025-10-27

We went to Papy and Mamy's yesterday. Elise came without complaint but spent most of the meal drawing on a napkin instead of talking. I watched her and wondered if I'm passing something down or just dragging her through motions that only mean something to me.

Took the finished canvases to the parish hall for a test hang. The light from the west window hit the river painting exactly the way it hits Grand-mere's piece in the catalogue photo from 1978. Same angle, same hour, same wall. Some things just line up when you let them.

## Entry 8 - 2025-11-04

Exhibition prep is wearing me thin. Maman called to say she might not do the tarte this year -- her hands are bothering her and she doesn't want to push it. I told her it's fine, but after I hung up I just sat in the studio staring at nothing for a while.

**Nudge:** "What were you sitting with in that silence?"
