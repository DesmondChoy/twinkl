# Persona 5fa8b540: Nisha Agarwal

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 5fa8b540
- **Name:** Nisha Agarwal
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Teacher
- **Culture:** South Asian
- **Core Values:** Universalism
- **Bio:** Nisha is a 22-year-old primary school teacher in Lucknow who took a lower-paying position at a government school serving children from migrant worker families instead of the private English-medium school her parents wanted. She volunteers on weekends with an NGO that runs literacy camps in nearby villages and has been quietly funneling portions of her salary toward sponsoring school supplies for students who can't afford them. Her older sister married well and settled in Bangalore, which only intensifies her parents' confusion about why Nisha chose what they call "the harder path."

Parent-teacher meeting ran late. Most parents didn't show up, same as last month. Spent the rest of the evening marking notebooks and helping Amma sort the kitchen.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-16

Went to the literacy camp in Sultanpur today and I keep thinking about this one girl, maybe seven or eight, who was holding the pencil like she'd never held one before. And honestly she probably hadn't. She was gripping it so tight her knuckles were white and she kept looking at me like she was asking permission to write her own name.

I sat with her for almost an hour. The other volunteers were doing group activities but I just couldn't move on from this kid. Her name is Fatima. She got the first two letters right and then she looked at me and smiled and it was like, okay, this is why I wake up early on Saturdays and take that awful bus that takes ninety minutes one way.

I know this sounds naive or whatever. Didi would say I'm romanticizing things. But I was there today and she wasn't. There's something about being in the room with someone who just learned they can write their own name that makes all the other noise—the salary complaints, Baba asking when I'll "move up," the crumbling school building—feel small. Not irrelevant, just not the point.

**Nudge:** "What keeps you going back every Saturday?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-23

Interesting thing happened during morning assembly. One of my Class 3 students, Ravi, came up to me after and said he told his mother about the water pollution lesson I did last week. She apparently asked him to explain it again because their neighborhood has been complaining about the nala running brown. He was so proud of himself, like he'd done something important.

And maybe he did? A nine-year-old going home and talking to his family about why their water is dirty—that feels like something actually working. Not in a big dramatic way, just a small thread pulling in the right direction. I changed nothing about anyone's pipes but now one family is paying attention. That's enough for today.

**Nudge:** "Do you think those small threads actually add up over time?"

**Response:** Have to believe they do, otherwise why bother.

Didi called from Bangalore. She's remodelling her flat and asked if I wanted her old furniture shipped to Lucknow. Said no thanks, my room barely fits what I already have. Realized after I hung up that we didn't talk about anything real.

Finished compiling the mid-term attendance data. Our school's retention rate is up from last year, which the principal seemed happy about. Stayed back to help the peon uncle fix a broken desk in my classroom.

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-08

Long day. Staff meeting after school ran for two hours and most of it was about budget allocation for the new computer lab. Fine, whatever, that matters too. But then Sharma sir made this comment about how "these children's parents don't even value education, so why are we bending over backwards with extra programs." A few teachers nodded. I just sat there.

I should have said something. These are my students he was talking about. Their parents work twelve-hour shifts at brick kilns and construction sites—of course they can't show up to every PTM. That doesn't mean they don't care. Ravi's mother walked forty minutes to come to the last one. But I kept quiet because Sharma sir is senior and it was the end of a long day and I didn't have the energy to start something. Took the bus home feeling like I'd swallowed something heavy.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from pushing back in that moment?"

**Response:** Honestly just tired. One comment doesn't change anything.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-09

Still thinking about yesterday but also something from today that's bothering me more. Went to the market after school to buy supplies for next week's art project. The stationery shop I usually go to was closed so I went to the bigger one near Hazratganj. More expensive but they had everything I needed.

Here's the thing. There's a local self-help group run by women from the basti near school—they make paper products, notebooks, craft materials. I know about them because one of my students' mothers is involved. They sell at lower prices and the money goes directly back to the community. I've bought from them before. But today I was tired and the Hazratganj shop was right there and I just wanted to get it done fast. So I spent probably twice as much at a chain store when I could have waited one more day and supported the women's group instead.

It's not a huge deal in isolation. Nobody's tracking my purchases. But it's the kind of thing that nags at me because I talk a lot, in my own head at least, about wanting things to be more fair, about wanting the system to work differently. And then when I have an actual tiny concrete chance to put money where my mouth is, I go for the convenient option. Feels hypocritical. The women's group doesn't need my patronage to survive but it's the principle of it. Or maybe I'm overthinking a stationery run, I don't know. I just don't like who I was at that checkout counter today.

**Nudge:** "Is it really about the stationery or something bigger?"

**Response:** It's bigger. Whether I actually live this way or just think it.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-16

Week went by fast. Exams are coming so the classroom mood has shifted—less exploration, more revision. I don't love exam season but it's part of the deal. Spent most of the week drilling multiplication tables and grammar rules, which is fine, just not what I find interesting about teaching.

Saturday camp was cancelled because of some local election rally blocking the roads to Sultanpur. So I had the whole day free, which almost never happens. Used it to reorganize my lesson plans for after the exams. Want to do a unit on water and sanitation since the Ravi thing showed me the kids actually carry these conversations home.

Baba asked over dinner if I'd thought about the B.Ed entrance coaching that Didi offered to pay for. He thinks a higher qualification will help me "move to a better school." I told him I like my school. He said he knows, but he worries. I think he genuinely does. It's not like Didi's thing where she's comparing our lives—Baba just wants to know I'll be okay. Told him I'm okay right now and that has to count for something. He nodded and changed the subject to cricket, which is his way of accepting things he doesn't fully understand. I'll take it.
