# Persona 7227db82: Ryu Tanaka

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 7227db82
- **Name:** Ryu Tanaka
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Entrepreneur
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Stimulation
- **Bio:** Ryu dropped out of Waseda University after one semester to launch a pop-up ramen delivery service in Tokyo, then pivoted to a bubble tea franchise concept within six months when the initial model felt stale. He's already on his third startup idea—a nightlife discovery app—and splits his time between Shibuya, Taipei, and Bangkok depending on where the next opportunity pulls him. His parents still send him job listings for consulting firms; he deletes them without reading.

## Entry 0 - 2025-04-18

Had a meeting this morning with the developer team in Bangkok about the app. We went over the feature backlog and prioritized the location-based discovery algorithm for the next sprint. The flight over was uneventful—grabbed the red-eye from Taipei so I could hit the ground running.

Afterward, I walked around Thonglor for a few hours. Found this basement bar that only opens after 11pm and doesn't show up on any maps. The owner is a former DJ from Berlin who moved here three years ago. We talked about how Bangkok's nightlife scene is evolving faster than Tokyo's right now. He introduced me to his network of venue owners. Could be useful for partnerships.

Spent the evening updating the pitch deck for next week's investor meeting in Singapore. The current traction numbers look decent but not explosive. Need to figure out how to make the growth story more compelling. Booked a hostel near Clarke Quay for the trip—the one with the rooftop bar where you can network with other founders.

**Nudge:** "That basement bar sounds wild. How'd you even find it?"

**Response:** Honestly, I just kept walking. I'd already been to the main spots everyone knows, and I was bored. Turned down some alley because I saw a guy carrying vinyl records disappear into a doorway. Followed him. Turns out the entrance is behind a laundromat. You have to know to knock twice. The owner said he doesn't want it on Google—says the moment a place gets discovered, it dies.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-20

Got another call from my mom today. She forwarded me a LinkedIn post about my high school classmate Kenji who just made senior associate at McKinsey Tokyo. She didn't say it directly, but I could hear it in her voice—"See? He has stability. What do you have?"

I have three half-built companies and a carry-on bag. I have a network across four cities. I have ideas that keep me up at night. But sure, I don't have a business card with a respectable title or a steady paycheck.

The thing is, I'm not failing. The app has 2,000 beta users already. We're getting organic signups from word of mouth. But to her, none of that counts until there's a salary deposited every month. She doesn't understand that the salary is the trap. That's how they get you—comfortable enough that you stop looking for what else is out there.

I know she means well. I know she just wants me to be okay. But her version of "okay" feels like suffocation. Every time we talk, I have to defend choices that feel obvious to me. It's exhausting.

The investor meeting is in three days. If this round comes through, maybe that'll finally be proof enough. Or maybe it won't matter and she'll just find something else to worry about.

**Nudge:** "You said she means well, then called it suffocation. Which one sits heavier?"

**Response:** Both, that's the problem. I know she loves me and that's exactly why it hurts. If she didn't care, I could just ignore her. But she does, and her caring looks like wanting me to be someone I'm not. The suffocation is heavier, if I'm being honest. Because at least if she were indifferent, I'd be free.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-20

Still thinking about that call. Went out tonight to clear my head—hit up three different rooftop bars with some founders I met last week. One of them is building a fintech play in Vietnam, another is doing sustainable fashion in Seoul. Neither of them has stable jobs either. Nobody questioned each other's choices.

Maybe that's why I surround myself with people like this. Not because I need validation, but because I need to be around people who get that the risk is the point. You don't build something new by playing it safe. And yeah, maybe some of us will fail—statistically, most of us will. But at least we'll know we tried something different.

**Nudge:** "Do those rooftop conversations ever make you feel like you're building your own family out here?"

**Response:** Ha, family is a strong word. We're more like... fellow travelers, I guess. People passing through the same checkpoint at the same time. Some of them I'll probably never see again after this month. That's fine though. I'm not looking for permanence.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-27

Investor meeting didn't go the way I hoped. They liked the concept but wanted to see "more traction" before committing. Classic. They want to fund things that are already working, not things that could work. Where's the vision in that?

I tried explaining that nightlife discovery is a category that doesn't exist yet—you can't show hockey stick growth for something people don't know they need until they have it. But they kept asking about retention metrics and monthly active users. Numbers I don't have because we're still in beta. It felt like being graded on a test I wasn't given.

My co-founder suggested we pivot to something safer. Maybe restaurant recommendations or travel itineraries—stuff with proven demand. I told him if I wanted to build something boring, I would've just stayed in university. That conversation didn't end well.

**Nudge:** "How'd it end with your co-founder? That sounds tense."

**Response:** He said I care more about the idea being interesting than the idea being successful. Like those are mutually exclusive. We're still talking, but there's this distance now. I think he wants out but doesn't want to say it directly. Maybe I should just ask. Or maybe I don't want to hear the answer.

Co-founder officially left. Can't say I'm surprised. Starting over again with a smaller team and lower runway, but weirdly I feel lighter. At least now every decision is mine.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-03

Why does everyone act like pivoting is failure? I've done it three times now and people look at me like I'm lost. I'm not lost—I'm searching. There's a difference. Lost means you don't know where you're going. Searching means you know the destination exists, you just haven't found the right path yet.

My aunt asked when I'm going to "settle down" with one business. Settle down. Like I'm supposed to marry a startup. Maybe the right one hasn't appeared yet. Maybe the point is to keep exploring until something feels like it can hold my attention for more than a year. Is that so wrong?

**Nudge:** "What would need to happen for something to finally hold your attention?"

**Response:** That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? I'll let you know when I figure it out. For now, I'm just trusting the process.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-09

Couldn't sleep last night. Kept thinking about the runway—four months left, maybe five if I cut costs. The app is growing but not fast enough. Wondering if I should take on contract work to extend the timeline or if that would just distract me from the main thing.

**Nudge:** "Is it the money keeping you up, or something else?"

**Response:** The money is the easy answer. But honestly, it's more like... what if I'm running out of runway on me? Like, what if I've been chasing this feeling of building something new for so long that I've forgotten how to actually finish anything? That thought hit me around 3am and I haven't been able to shake it.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-10

Spent the day wandering Shibuya without any plan. Haven't done that in months—usually I'm running between meetings or on a call with someone in a different timezone. But today I just walked. Watched people. Sat in a coffee shop for three hours. Read a book I've been meaning to finish since January.

There's this weird guilt that comes with unproductive time. Like I should be building or networking or optimizing something. But also... I felt more present than I have in weeks. Noticed things I usually miss. The way the light hits the buildings around 4pm. The sound of trains overhead mixed with street musicians.

I used to do this all the time in university—before I decided that was boring and left. Maybe the problem isn't that I need more novelty. Maybe I've just been looking for it in the wrong places. Or maybe I'm just tired and romanticizing a slow day because it's different from my usual pace.

Either way, it was good. I think I needed to remember that standing still isn't the same as being stuck.

**Nudge:** "What made today feel different from being stuck?"

**Response:** I chose it. That's the difference. When I'm stuck, it feels like the walls are closing in and I can't move. Today I could've moved—I just decided not to. There's freedom in that. The stillness was on my terms.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-15

Had a call with a potential angel investor today. She's based in Hong Kong, built and exited two companies before she was 35, now advises early-stage founders in the region. She listened to my pitch, asked sharp questions, and then said something that's been echoing in my head since.

She said: "You clearly have energy. But energy without focus is just noise. What's the one thing you're willing to be boring about for the next five years?"

Five years. That's longer than any relationship I've had—with a person or a project. The question isn't whether I can handle it. It's whether I even want to. Part of me thinks that's the whole point: find the thing worth being boring for. Another part of me thinks that's just conformity dressed up in startup language.

I don't know. I told her I'd think about it. She said that's fine, but the market won't wait forever for me to figure myself out. She's probably right. She also said she'd check in next month to see where my head's at.

The runway isn't just money. It's time. And I'm spending both whether I have a plan or not.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-22

Called my mom today—not because she called me, but because I wanted to. Told her about the investor meeting, the co-founder leaving, the uncertainty. She listened more than she lectured, which was surprising. At the end, she just said: "You'll figure it out. You always do. Just don't forget to eat."

It wasn't the conversation I expected. Maybe I've been so busy defending myself that I forgot she's also capable of just being my mom. Not the version of her I argue against in my head, but the real one who's worried and proud in equal measure.

Still don't know what I'm going to tell the angel investor next month. But I'm less afraid of the question now. Maybe the answer doesn't have to be forever. Maybe it just has to be honest.
