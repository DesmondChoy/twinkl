People keep telling me I take on too much. The vice principal said it again today after I stayed past six finishing the mid-term analysis spreadsheets. But someone has to track which students are falling behind, and nobody else is doing it systematically. It's not like I'm trying to be a martyr. I just know what happens when these kids slip through the cracks -- they end up in the same cycle their parents were stuck in.

Anyway, the reading club had its best turnout this week. Fourteen students. Two of them are reading a full grade level above where they started in September. That's not nothing. That's the whole point.

**Nudge:** "You say it's not martyrdom. What is it then?"

**Response:** I think it's that I can't separate myself from the outcome. Like if Ravi in 8B fails his English paper, I take it personally because I saw the warning signs in October and I had the data. If I'd just done one more review session, maybe. I know that's not entirely rational but that's how it sits in my chest.

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-14

Got the district assessment results back. My class average is fourth out of nine sections. Fourth. I worked harder than anyone in that staffroom and fourth is what I get.

**Nudge:** "Fourth out of nine is above the middle. What number would have felt okay?"

**Response:** First. Or at least second. I know how that sounds. But I mapped every student's weak areas, I differentiated the worksheets, I came in on Saturdays. The sections that beat me have teachers who've been doing this for fifteen years. I've been at it for three. Part of me knows I should be proud but the other part just sees the gap.

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-14

Still thinking about the rankings. Came home and opened my laptop to look at the breakdown by question type and I can see exactly where my students lost marks -- the inference questions, the ones that require them to read between lines. And honestly that tracks because half my class comes from homes where there aren't books, where nobody reads to them, where the language of the test isn't even the language they think in. So the test is measuring something, sure, but it's measuring something that has more to do with privilege than with whether I taught well.

Which makes it worse in a way because now I'm angry at the system and at myself simultaneously. Angry at the system for pretending this is a level field. Angry at myself for caring about the ranking anyway when I know it's flawed. I spent two hours building supplementary inference exercises tonight instead of eating dinner. Amma would lose her mind if she knew.

I keep circling. If I focus on the ranking I feel like I failed. If I focus on the injustice I feel helpless. There's no version of this where I just sit with it and feel fine.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-18

Had the NGO water-mapping session today and it hit different this time. We tested samples from a borewell near the school and the iron content was nearly three times the safe limit. Three times. These kids drink this water. They fill bottles from this tap during lunch break. I've watched them do it.

I reported it to the block office last month and the response was basically a form letter saying it's been "noted for review." Noted for review. Meanwhile Lakshmi in 7A has been complaining about stomach aches every other week and I don't have proof it's the water but I also can't not think about it.

The grounding part is that at least now I have data. Six months of readings from twelve sites. The NGO coordinator said we have enough to go to the press if the block office keeps stalling. It feels like something I can actually push on, unlike the test scores where I'm just one teacher against a whole structure. Small difference, maybe, but it's mine.

## Entry 4 - 2025-01-19

Sunday and I told myself I'd take the day off but here I am at the kitchen table with three stacks of papers. One is the inference worksheets I'm piloting Monday. One is the water quality report I'm formatting for the NGO. One is the mid-year self-evaluation the school wants by Wednesday.

Amma called while I was in the middle of all this and asked when I'm coming home to visit. I said maybe February. She said I said that in November too. She's right. I haven't been back to Thrissur since Onam. Seven months. My cousin got engaged and I sent a gift instead of showing up. I keep telling myself I'll go once things settle down but things never settle down because I keep finding more things that need doing.

The self-evaluation is funny because they want me to rate myself on a scale of one to five across these categories and I genuinely don't know what to put. On effort I'd say five without hesitation. On results -- by the district's measure -- maybe a three? And then there's this whole other dimension they don't even ask about, like the fact that Ravi can now write a paragraph without freezing up, or that the water report exists at all. None of that fits in a checkbox.

**Nudge:** "Seven months away from home. What do you miss most?"

**Response:** My grandmother's rice kanji in the morning. The sound of the rain on the tin roof extension my uncle built. Amma not having to ask me through a phone screen if I'm eating properly. I miss being in a place where nobody's evaluating me and I'm not evaluating myself. I just exist there. But then I think about Monday's lesson plan and the water report deadline and the missing feels like something I can't afford right now.

## Entry 5 - 2025-01-25

Colleague asked me at lunch if I'd considered just "letting the NGO stuff go for a bit" since the term is getting intense. She meant well, I think, but it rubbed me the wrong way. Letting it go means those water readings sit in a folder and nothing happens. Letting it go means the block office gets to keep ignoring it. That's not something I can just put on pause because my marking load went up.

But I will say this -- I did manage to set a boundary this week. Told the NGO coordinator I can only do fieldwork every other Saturday instead of every week. It felt wrong at first, like I was abandoning something, but I also got through the week without that Sunday-night dread for the first time in a while. That's worth something.

**Nudge:** "You felt relief cutting back but also guilt. Which one do you trust more?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-01-27

Barely functioning today. Slept maybe four hours because I was up redoing the inference module after I realized the reading passages I'd chosen were too culturally specific -- references to summer camps and snow days that my students have zero frame of reference for. So I rewrote three of them using contexts they'd actually recognize. Market scenes, monsoon flooding, cricket matches. It took until 2 AM but when I tested the first passage on a few students during break today, the difference was immediate. They were actually engaging with the inference questions instead of getting stuck on vocabulary.

I'm exhausted but I'm also weirdly satisfied. This is what the district rankings don't capture. The test uses standardized passages that assume a particular kind of childhood. I can't change the test but I can build the bridge to it. My students scored low on inference not because they can't infer -- they do it constantly in their daily lives, navigating languages, reading social cues -- but because the test's version of inference lives in a world they've never been to.

I need to sleep more. I know that. But nights like last night are also when I do my best thinking because nobody's pinging me and I can just sit with the material. It's a trade-off I keep making and I'm not sure it's sustainable but right now it's working.

## Entry 7 - 2025-01-29

Three things happened today worth noting.

First, the block education officer called about the water report. They're sending someone to re-test the borewell next week. Not a full commitment to fixing anything, but the fact that they called instead of sending another form letter means the pressure is working. The NGO coordinator wants to submit the full dataset to the state environmental board as a parallel track. I agreed.

Second, I ran the revised inference module in two of my sections. Pass rate on the practice set went from 38% to 61%. That's with the same students, same difficulty level, just different cultural framing in the passages. I documented everything -- the original scores, the revised passages, the new scores. If I'm going to argue that the standardized test is biased, I need evidence, not just frustration.

Third, the vice principal flagged me for the district's "Emerging Educator" recognition. I didn't ask for it. Apparently my mid-term data tracking caught someone's attention higher up. I should feel good about it but mostly I feel like the recognition is for the wrong thing. They noticed the spreadsheet, not the Saturday reading club. They noticed the data, not the kids.

## Entry 8 - 2025-02-02

Amma called again. She's upset I'm not coming for Pongal. I tried to explain that February is when I need to prep the students for boards and I genuinely cannot take three days off right now. She said "you always have a reason" and I could hear that specific disappointment in her voice, the kind that doesn't argue, just goes quiet.

I don't know how to make her understand that the reason I can't come home is the same reason she wanted me to become a teacher in the first place. She raised me to care about this. She's the one who drove me to the library every Saturday when I was ten. She's the one who cried when I got the appointment letter. So how is it that doing the thing she was proud of is also the thing that keeps me away from her? I know she doesn't see it that way. She just misses me. But I can't hold both of those things at the same time without something cracking.

## Entry 9 - 2025-02-08

Week in review. The borewell got re-tested by the block office team. Results confirmed what our data showed -- iron at 2.8 times the limit, plus elevated nitrates we hadn't caught with our field kit. They've issued a notice to the school to install a filter system within 60 days. It took six months of volunteer hours to get to this point. Six months for something that should have been caught by routine inspection.

On the school side, I submitted my Emerging Educator portfolio. Included the inference module data alongside the standard metrics. I wrote a one-page note arguing that student performance gains should be measured against where students started, not against an absolute benchmark that ignores context. Don't know if anyone will read it. But it's on record.

Personally, I'm in a strange place. I should feel like I'm winning. The water issue is moving. My students are improving. I got recognized by the district. But I missed Pongal. I haven't called my grandmother in three weeks. I ate dinner at my desk every night this week. There's this gap between the things I'm accomplishing and how I actually feel, and I don't know what to do with it. I keep performing well by every external measure while something internal stays unsorted.

**Nudge:** "That gap you mentioned -- what would it take to close it?"

**Response:** I honestly don't know. Maybe it's not something you close. Maybe it's just the cost of caring about things that are bigger than your own life. The water report matters more than my comfort. My students' futures matter more than my sleep schedule. I believe that. But believing it doesn't make the tiredness go away, and it doesn't make Amma's silence on the phone hurt less. I think what I need is for someone to tell me it's okay to be proud and depleted at the same time. That those aren't contradictions.
