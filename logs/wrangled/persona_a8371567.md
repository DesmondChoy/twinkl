## Entry 0 - 2025-07-05

My mother-in-law came by today and made some comment about the stack of translation documents on the kitchen table. Something about how I should focus on the kids instead of "outside projects." I smiled and said I'd clear them after lunch. But it sat with me the rest of the afternoon.

She doesn't understand what those documents are. Each one is someone's asylum application or work permit or medical form that they can't read because nobody thought to print it in a language they actually speak. I can do that. I can sit at my kitchen table after the kids are asleep and make that one thing less terrifying for someone. And my kids are fed, they're healthy, they're fine. I don't need to justify this to anyone, but I keep feeling like I have to.

**Nudge:** "You said you don't need to justify it. So why does it still sit with you?"

**Response:** Because she's not wrong that there are only so many hours. I chose to stay home for the kids. But the work I left behind didn't stop needing to be done. I just can't shake the feeling that I'm supposed to pick one and be at peace with it, and I haven't figured out how to do that yet.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-12

Residents association meeting tonight about the new recycling sorting rules the district is rolling out. I volunteered to run the information session for our building because nobody else would and the flyer they sent was confusing — mixing up the plastic codes and getting the compost pickup schedule wrong. Spent two hours after the kids' bedtime redoing the flyer in Korean and English since we have several non-Korean families in the complex.

Hyun-woo got home late again and asked why I was still up. I showed him the flyer and he said "can't someone else do this?" He wasn't being mean. He just doesn't get why I'd spend a free evening on something that could theoretically be someone else's problem.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you'd just left the flyer as it was?"

**Response:** The wrong information would go out and our building would get fined again, and the two Filipina families on the fourth floor who can barely read the Korean notices would have no idea what changed. I keep thinking about Mrs. Reyes carrying her bags to the wrong bin last month looking confused and embarrassed. Nobody helped her. I can't see that and not do something. It physically bothers me to walk past a problem I could fix.

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-17

Took the kids to the park near the river this morning. Eun-bi wanted to feed the ducks and Jun-ho wanted to throw rocks, so we compromised — ducks first, then rocks at a different spot. Standard negotiation. It was actually nice until I noticed a group of volunteers doing a river cleanup downstream. They had those grabber tools and black trash bags and matching vests from some environmental group I didn't recognize.

I stood there watching them for probably five minutes while the kids played. Part of me wanted to walk over and ask how to join. I used to do cleanups like that every month before Jun-ho was born. Our old NGO partnered with a river conservation group in Mapo-gu and I'd spend whole Saturdays hauling plastic out of the Cheonggyecheon tributaries. Felt like I was doing something tangible, something I could point at and say today this stretch of water is cleaner because I was here.

Now I watch from the playground. I'm not complaining about my life — the kids are wonderful and I chose this. But there's this gap between what I used to be able to do and what my days look like now. I don't know what to do with that gap except notice it and move on. Jun-ho threw a rock into the water and it made a perfect splash and he was so proud. I clapped and said "good one" and we went home for lunch.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-17

Can't sleep. Kept thinking about the river cleanup people. Found their group online — they meet every Saturday, which is the one morning Hyun-woo is reliably home with the kids. I could go. But then I'd be giving up the only morning I have for grocery shopping, meal prep, and the laundry pile that's been staring at me all week.

My friend Ji-yeon texted asking if I wanted to join her yoga class on Saturday mornings. Everyone keeps offering me ways to spend my time that are about me. Yoga, self-care, "you need a break." But I don't want a break. I want to be useful beyond these walls. That probably sounds ungrateful. I have a warm apartment and two healthy children and a husband who comes home every night. But I keep reading the news about the factory fire in Gimpo where those migrant workers were locked in because the exits were blocked and I can't just — I can't just do yoga about it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-07-20

Went to the refugee resettlement office for my translation shift. They had a backlog of about forty documents — medical intake forms, mostly. One was for a family from Myanmar with three kids under ten. The mother had written additional notes in the margins in Burmese that I couldn't read, so I flagged them for the Burmese translator. Just small handwritten lines. Probably questions she was too afraid to ask out loud. That kind of thing breaks something in me every time.

Came home and Eun-bi had drawn a picture of our family at school. She drew me holding a big stack of papers. Hyun-woo laughed and said "even she knows." I laughed too but it landed weird. Like even my six-year-old sees me as the woman with the papers instead of — I don't know. I don't know what I expected her to draw. I am the woman with the papers. I just wish that didn't feel like it needed defending.

**Nudge:** "What did you want her to draw instead?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-21

Both kids had fevers last night so I was up every two hours with wet towels and children's Tylenol. Jun-ho finally slept at 4am. I skipped the recycling committee meeting and I feel guilty about it even though I know that's absurd.

**Nudge:** "Why does skipping it feel like a failure?"

**Response:** Because I told Mrs. Park I'd present the updated sorting schedule and now she has to scramble. I know she'll manage. I know my kids come first. But letting someone down — even for a completely valid reason — just eats at me. It always has.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-22

Kids are better. Jun-ho's fever broke around noon and Eun-bi was already bouncing off the walls by breakfast. Hyun-woo took the afternoon off which almost never happens, so I had about three hours to myself. I should have napped. Instead I sat on the balcony with my laptop and read through the news.

There's a piece about a proposed bill that would make it harder for undocumented workers to access emergency medical care. I read it twice. Then I started drafting a letter to our local representative, citing cases I'd seen at the resettlement office — anonymized, of course. I wrote about the Myanmar family's intake forms and the gap between what the system promises and what reaches people. It took me two hours and I don't even know if anyone will read it.

Hyun-woo came in and saw me typing and said nothing. He just made me tea and left it on the desk. I think he's given up trying to understand why I spend my rare free hours this way. He's not angry. He's just resigned. And I can feel the distance in that resignation. Like he's accepted that this is who I am but he'd prefer a version of me who could sit on the balcony and just look at the sky. Some days I'd prefer that version too. But I open the news and there's another factory fire or another deportation story or another kid who fell through the cracks and I can't look at the sky. The sky is not the problem.

Sent the letter. Also emailed the river cleanup group about joining their Saturday rotation starting August. Hyun-woo agreed to handle Saturday mornings. Feels like a small step but at least it's forward.

## Entry 8 - 2025-07-28

First Saturday cleanup. Hauled three bags of plastic from a 200-meter stretch near Banpo Bridge. Got home muddy and sunburned. Eun-bi asked if I was "saving the river" and I said I was trying.

**Nudge:** "How did it feel being back out there?"
