## Entry 0 - 2025-03-10

Got back from Nashik at ten, meeting ran five hours longer than planned. Supplier wants to renegotiate the whole contract because of raw material costs going up again. My back is aching from the drive but the deal isn't done so I'll be back there Wednesday. At least the evening puja helped settle my mind before the drive home.

**Nudge:** "What about the Nashik deal has you going back so soon?"

**Response:** It's just business. These things take time. Anyway, the real issue is that my production manager called in sick today and we've got a client audit on Friday.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-12

Aarav called from Singapore this morning, first time in two weeks. He sounded good, talking about some new project at work, some kind of payment infrastructure thing. I don't understand half of what he describes but I can hear when he's fired up about it. He asked about Maa and I told him she's fine, that she made his favorite kaju katli last week and kept a box aside even though nobody's coming to collect it. He laughed but I don't think he caught what I was saying.

It's strange because I built this company partly so there would be something for the next generation to step into. My father had the first small shop, I turned it into a proper operation, and the idea was always that Aarav would take it further. He knows the business, he grew up in it. But he looked at it and chose something else. I respect that, I do. But there's a gap now in how I think about what comes next.

Had a good meeting with the sustainability consultants after lunch. They think we can get the biodegradable line certified by Q3 if we commit the capital. Numbers look solid. I told them I'd decide by end of month. Thirty years ago I would have said yes on the spot but now I sit with things longer. Not sure if that's wisdom or just fatigue.

**Nudge:** "Is the gap about the company or something bigger?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-12

Second entry today because I can't sleep and writing seems better than staring at the ceiling fan. Went back to Maa's for Thursday dinner even though it's only Wednesday. She didn't ask why, just set an extra plate. She made dal the way Baba used to like it, with the whole red chilies left in. Sitting at that table, same steel plates we've used since I was a boy, I felt like things made sense for a moment. The dal tasted exactly right.

Came back and sat with the Q1 numbers. Revenue is up eleven percent but margins are thinner because of the raw material situation. The Nashik supplier is squeezing us and he knows we don't have many alternatives for that grade of recycled fiber. I've been in business long enough to know when someone has leverage and is using it. Need to find a second source, but that takes time and relationship-building, and right now I'm stretched.

I keep coming back to what Aarav said on the phone, that he's building something from scratch. I did that too, once. Took my father's small operation and built it into something real. Maybe that's what he needs to do on his own terms. I just wish his terms didn't put him seven thousand kilometers away. Anyway. The dal was good tonight. That's enough for one day.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-14

Rajiv Kulkarni just got written up in Business Standard. They did a full profile, his logistics company apparently crossed the five-hundred-crore mark. We went to COEP together, started our companies the same year. He's always been three steps ahead, or at least that's how it reads in the papers. My company does good work, honest work, but nobody's writing profiles about steady growth in packaging materials. I know comparison is pointless but I looked at that article for too long this morning.

Then I caught myself wondering if Aarav would have stayed if the company was bigger. If there was something more impressive for him to inherit. That's an ugly thought and I know it, but it sat there in my chest for a while before I could push it aside. The truth is the company is solid. We employ over two hundred people, we pay on time, we've never missed a delivery commitment in six years. That means something. It just doesn't make the business papers.

Had the Nashik meeting. Drove back and went straight to the factory to check on the audit prep. Suresh had it mostly handled, which was a relief. Got home past nine. Shobha had kept dinner but I could tell she was irritated I didn't call. She's right. I should have called. I just get tunnel vision when I'm in it.

**Nudge:** "You called that thought ugly. Why did it stick?"

**Response:** Because it means I'm measuring my own son's loyalty against a revenue number. And that's exactly the kind of thinking I always told myself I wouldn't fall into. My father never once talked about the size of his shop. He talked about the quality of his paper, the customers who came back for twenty years. Somewhere I started keeping score differently and I don't like what that says.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-14

Shobha brought up the Varanasi trip again at breakfast. Her mother's eightieth birthday is in April and the whole family is expected. She's already booked the train tickets. I told her I'll come for the weekend portion but can't take the full week off. She went quiet in that way she does when she's decided I'm wrong but isn't going to argue about it in the morning.

The thing is, I want to go. I actually do. Shobha's mother has always been kind to me. The ghats in the morning, the aarti at Dashashwamedh — there's a stillness in Varanasi that I don't find anywhere else. And the whole family gathers, cousins I haven't seen in years, the children running around. But the biodegradable line decision needs to happen and I can't hand that off. It's a forty-lakh capital commitment and some things you sign yourself.

Called the Nashik supplier after lunch. Offered a two-year lock-in at current rates. He said he'd think about it. Also interviewed a candidate for the assistant production manager role. Decent on paper but too eager to impress, kept dropping the names of companies he's worked with instead of talking about what he actually did. I'll see two more candidates next week.

**Nudge:** "When's the last time you sat in that stillness?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-19

Shobha told her sister I'm only coming for the weekend and apparently the whole family knows now. Got a call from her brother asking if everything is okay with us. Everything is fine. I'm running a company. People act like taking time off is some kind of moral test. My own father worked six days a week until he was seventy-two and nobody questioned his commitment to the family. He showed up when it mattered and so do I.

Signed off on the biodegradable line investment today. Forty-two lakhs when you include the testing certification. It's the right call. Suresh and I went through the projections twice. If the pilot customers convert, we'll break even by Q1 next year. Felt good to make the decision. Some days the work is the clearest thing I have.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-24

Maa asked me tonight if I'm happy. Just like that, over chai, no context. I said of course, what kind of question is that. She just looked at me and sipped her tea. Mothers see through everything. I changed the subject to the new dal recipe she's trying but it sat with me the whole drive home.

**Nudge:** "What do you think she was seeing?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-26

Production line for the new biodegradable material started trial runs today. Watched the first batch come through and it's not right yet — the tensile strength is off, tears too easily. The engineers say it's a calibration issue, two or three more iterations. I've heard that before. But the raw material itself feels promising. Held a sheet of it and it had good weight, good texture. These are the moments I still like about this work, when something you decided on paper becomes real in your hands.

Aarav sent photos of his apartment. It's small but he's furnished it well. He has one of Maa's old brass diyas on his bookshelf, the one she gave him when he left. I zoomed in on the photo just to make sure I was seeing it right. He didn't mention it in the message, just the new coffee table and the view. But he kept it. He put it where he could see it.

Had lunch with Patil from the industry association. He's retiring next year and asked if I'd consider taking his seat on the board. I said I'd think about it. Ten years ago I would have jumped at the visibility. Now I'm not sure I want another obligation. The days are already full. But Patil's father and my father knew each other, and there's something about continuing those connections that matters.

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-27

Varanasi trip logistics settled. I'll arrive Friday evening instead of Saturday morning. Shobha seemed pleased when I told her, though she didn't make a big deal of it. I moved two meetings and delegated the supplier follow-up to Suresh. The company will survive three days without me. Writing that down feels like something I need to remind myself of more often.

Biodegradable line second trial was better. Tensile strength improved after the temperature adjustment. Still not where we need it for the food packaging spec but trending the right direction. Told the team I want a third trial by next Wednesday with the modified polymer blend. Set a target of reaching spec by mid-April. If we hit it, we can go to the pilot customers with samples before monsoon season complicates the logistics.

Also called Aarav in the evening. Didn't have a specific reason, just wanted to hear his voice. We talked for twenty minutes about nothing in particular, his weekend plans, a temple he found near his flat that does a small morning puja. He said he's been going on Sundays. I didn't know that. I said nothing about it because I didn't want to make it into a thing, but after we hung up I sat on the balcony for a long time feeling something I can't quite name. Relief, maybe. Or recognition.

**Nudge:** "Relief or recognition — which one sits closer?"

**Response:** Recognition. Like seeing something of yourself show up in your child without you having to put it there. I never told him to go to temple. He saw me and Maa do it his whole life and now he's finding his own version of it, seven thousand kilometers away. That means something got through. Not the company, not the career path, but something underneath all of that.

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-31

Back from Varanasi. The trip was good. Shobha's mother was genuinely surprised we came a day early. We did the aarti on Saturday evening, the whole family standing along the ghat with the flames reflected on the water. My brother-in-law and I talked business for a bit but mostly we just ate too much and let the kids run circles around us. Slept better those three nights than I have in months.

Got to the factory this morning and Suresh had handled everything cleanly. One minor quality flag on a shipment that he resolved. The Nashik supplier accepted the two-year lock-in. Good. Checked the third trial results on the biodegradable line — we're within eight percent of target spec. Close. I told the team to push for one more round by Friday.

**Nudge:** "You slept better in Varanasi. What was different?"

**Response:** No alarm. No production numbers to check before anyone else gets in. I woke up to temple bells and Shobha already dressed and ready for the morning walk along the river. I think I've forgotten what it feels like to not be the first person solving problems each day. In Varanasi I was just someone's son-in-law, someone's uncle. There was nothing to prove to anyone. I didn't realize how tired I was of being the one who holds everything until I put it down for three days.

## Entry 10 - 2025-04-05

Shobha asked if maybe we could go to Varanasi more often, maybe once a quarter. I said that's not realistic with the business right now, especially with the new product line launching. She said she's not asking me to shut the factory down, just to take a few days. I know she's not being unreasonable. But there's a part of me that tightens up when someone asks me to step away from the work. Like if I stop, everything stops. I know that's not true. Suresh just proved that last week.

Patil called again about the board seat. I told him I'd accept. It felt like the right thing. His father and mine started in the same market forty years ago, and if I can help the next group of small manufacturers the way the association helped me when I was starting out, that's worth the time. Shobha raised an eyebrow when I told her I'd taken on something new the same week she asked for more time off together. She has a point. I'm going to have to sort that out.

Fourth trial on the biodegradable line hit target spec. Finally. The team earned a day off and I told them so. Sent Aarav a photo of the sample sheet. He wrote back, "Looks like the future." Three words, but they landed right.
