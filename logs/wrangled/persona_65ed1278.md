## Entry 0 - 2025-02-25

The faculty review came back today and my department scored highest on the new pedagogical alignment rubric. Twenty-eight years and it still lands when the numbers confirm what you feel in the classroom. I printed the summary and put it in the drawer with the others.

Ran into Katja on the way out, one of the newer teachers I meet on Mondays. She was upset about a parent complaint and I stayed an extra forty minutes walking her through how to frame the follow-up email. Got home late again but Brigitte had already eaten. Didn't say anything about it. I think she's stopped expecting dinner together on school days.

**Nudge:** "What did Brigitte not saying anything feel like?"

**Response:** Honestly, worse than if she had complained. When she used to get frustrated I could at least argue I was doing something that mattered. The silence feels like she's decided it's not worth the effort. And I don't know what to do with that because the work genuinely does matter to me, but so does she. I just can't seem to make the hours stretch.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-04

Markus got the state teaching prize nomination. Markus. He's been at the school nine years and I recommended him for the department two years ago because I saw potential. Which is fine, good for him, I even wrote a reference. But I keep circling back to the fact that nobody thought to put my name forward and I've been building this department since before he finished university.

Maybe it's that the committee wants fresh faces. Or maybe my work has become furniture, something everyone relies on but nobody actually sees. I spent an hour tonight reorganising the spreadsheet of student outcomes to see if I'm slipping. I'm not. The numbers are solid. But the numbers don't seem to matter to whoever fills out the nomination form.

**Nudge:** "You recommended him and he got the nomination. Where does that leave you?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-09

Monday coffee with Katja, Leon, and Simone. Katja brought a lesson plan she'd redesigned using a framework I introduced two years ago and it was genuinely good. I told her so. Leon asked if I'd review his assessment rubric by Wednesday. Simone needed help navigating a difficult student's parents. I said yes to both without thinking.

Walking home I realised I hadn't touched my own conference paper all week. The submission deadline is in three weeks and I've been telling myself I'd carve out evenings for it. Instead the evenings go to other people's problems. I don't resent them for asking. I resent myself for not being able to say not this week.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-13

Parent evening ran until nine. One father spent twenty minutes questioning why his son got a B+ instead of an A on the Cold War unit and I had to sit there with my folder of rubrics defending a grade I know is fair. This is the part of the job that drains me. Not the teaching, the performing.

Got home and Brigitte asked if I'd remembered to call my sister for her birthday. I hadn't. Sat on the couch for ten minutes not moving before I picked up the phone. Hilde sounded fine but I could tell she noticed I was going through the motions. Another thing I let slide because the school day swallowed everything.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-16

Sunday. Actually managed the whole afternoon without opening the laptop. Brigitte and I drove out to the Eifel, walked a trail we used to do when the kids were small. She pointed out the bench where Thomas fell asleep once, years ago, and we both laughed. It felt like coming back to something.

On the drive home I told her about the conference paper and how behind I am. She said maybe I should let the Monday coffees go for a few weeks. I know she's right in a practical sense. But those three depend on me right now, especially Katja, and I think what I give them matters more than another line on my CV. Or maybe I just tell myself that because it's easier than sitting alone with a half-finished draft.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you told them you needed a few weeks?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-19

Markus won the prize. Everyone clapped at the staff meeting and I clapped too. My hands felt mechanical.

**Nudge:** "What were you thinking while you clapped?"

**Response:** That the cake they brought was dry. No, I don't know. It's done, he earned it, I should move on.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-20

Spent the evening reviewing Leon's rubric instead of the conference paper again. It's becoming a pattern I can see clearly but apparently not interrupt.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-21

Submitted a request to attend the European History Educators Conference in June. The head approved it immediately, said I'm long overdue for professional development. That felt decent. It's been four years since my last conference.

Called Hilde properly this time, no agenda, just to talk. She told me about her garden renovation and I actually listened instead of mentally drafting lesson plans. She said I sounded different, more present. I'll take that.

---

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-21

Second thought today. After calling Hilde I sat with my conference paper draft and got two decent pages written. The argument is about how we teach democratic participation as abstract principle rather than practiced skill, and once I started pulling examples from my own classroom it flowed better than I expected.

Brigitte came in with tea around ten and read over my shoulder for a minute. She said it sounded like me at my best, which is the kind of thing she doesn't say often enough for me to take it lightly. I saved the file and actually closed the laptop before midnight. Small accomplishment but I'll count it.

**Nudge:** "What made tonight different from the other evenings?"

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-23

Monday coffee again. This time I told the three of them I'd need to scale back for the next two weeks because of the paper deadline. Katja immediately said of course, Leon nodded, Simone looked a bit lost but said she understood. Nobody collapsed. Nobody resented it, at least not visibly.

Walking home I felt lighter than I have in weeks but also oddly guilty, as though I'd broken an unspoken contract. Brigitte would say that contract only exists in my head. She'd probably be right. I sat down with the draft again after dinner and got another page done. The structure is taking shape.

**Nudge:** "Where does that unspoken contract come from?"

**Response:** My father, probably. He was a teacher too, and his door was always open. Students, colleagues, neighbours. I grew up believing that being good at what you do means being available to everyone who needs you. The problem is you can spend a whole career being available and still feel like you haven't done the thing you were actually capable of. I don't want to retire with a drawer full of other people's thank-you cards and an empty shelf where my own work should have been.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-25

Brigitte said something last night that I keep turning over. We were in the kitchen and she mentioned, casually, that she'd stopped inviting the Fischers for dinner because I always cancel or sit there half-present checking my phone for student emails. I started to argue but she cut me off and said she wasn't angry, just adjusting. That word, adjusting, hit harder than any argument.

I've been telling myself the work matters, and it does. The department results prove it, the younger teachers tell me constantly how much the Monday sessions help. But Brigitte adjusting means she's already factored in my absence as the default. My sister noticed the same thing on the phone last week. I don't think I'm neglecting them on purpose. It's more that every time I choose between something with a measurable outcome and something that just asks me to be present, I pick the one I can point to later and say, see, this counted.

I don't know when being present stopped counting for me. Or if it ever did count and I just never built the habit of valuing it properly. The conference paper is going well now and I should feel satisfied. But Brigitte adjusting is sitting in my chest like a stone and I can't spreadsheet my way out of it.
