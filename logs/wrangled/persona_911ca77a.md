The Hamburg hub finally hit ninety-six percent on-time and I didn't even get a mention in the quarterly call. Kramer presented the numbers like they were his. Sat there chewing my pen while the board nodded along.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from speaking up during the call?"

**Response:** Politics. Kramer reports to the CEO directly. Picking a fight on camera would only hurt me.

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-15

Still stewing over the call. Lotte opened a bottle of that 2019 Brunello we'd been saving for something and I couldn't even enjoy it properly. Kept replaying the moment where Kramer said "the regional team" instead of my name. The regional team. Like the numbers came out of nowhere.

It's not just vanity, though people would say it is. When you run three sites and you restructure the nightshift rotation yourself and you push back on corporate for months to get the new sorting line funded, having your name attached to the outcome matters. It's how you move up. It's how people know who to call when the next VP seat opens.

**Nudge:** "What happens if the VP seat opens and they don't think of you?"

**Response:** Then six years of building this region into the best-performing in the company would have been a waste. And I'd have to seriously think about whether I stay or find somewhere that notices.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-17

Two of my warehouse leads called in sick on the same day and I spent six hours on the floor sorting parcels like it's 2003. My back is wrecked. Cancelled dinner reservations at that new place in Katendrecht because I couldn't face sitting upright for two hours.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-19

Had the one-on-one with Kramer today. Brought up the quarterly call, kept it measured. He said he appreciated my "team-first attitude" and that everyone knows who does the real work. Classic deflection. He even patted me on the shoulder on the way out, which I found condescending but smiled through anyway.

Lotte says I should document everything from now on. She's probably right. She also said I need to stop letting work ruin my evenings, because last weekend I spent the entire Saturday sailing trip checking emails on my phone instead of actually being out there. She's definitely right about that one. I barely noticed the water.

**Nudge:** "You said you barely noticed the water. How often does that happen — being somewhere you chose to be but not really being there?"

**Response:** More than I'd like. But that's the deal when you run things, isn't it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-25

Got the green light to hire two senior coordinators for the Antwerp hub. My budget, my picks, no committee. Finally something that feels like actual authority instead of managing upwards all day. Already have a shortlist.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-30

Hosted twelve people for dinner last night. Lotte paired every course — she did the lamb with a Châteauneuf-du-Pape that made van der Berg's wife close her eyes when she tasted it. That's the kind of evening I live for. Good food, the right people, candles on the canal, Lotte in her element. Van der Berg even asked if we'd consider doing a supper club. I said maybe, but honestly I don't want to turn it into an obligation.

The thing is, half the guests were people from the industry. Not a coincidence. You build your network over a cheese course, not in a meeting room. Van der Berg sits on the advisory board at Port of Rotterdam. His wife runs procurement at Maersk Benelux. I like these people genuinely — I do — but I also know exactly what those relationships are worth. Lotte says I can never just have fun without an angle. She's not wrong, but I don't see why it can't be both.

**Nudge:** "When Lotte says you always have an angle — does that bother you or does it feel like a compliment?"

**Response:** Depends on the day. Sometimes I think she sees through me in a way that's useful. Other times it makes me feel like I can't just enjoy something without her questioning my motives.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-05

Long week. The Antwerp expansion hit a snag — permits delayed, which means the two coordinators I hired start in three weeks with nothing structured for them to do. I've been on calls with the municipal office, with legal, with the construction firm, trying to unstick things. None of it is technically my job. The site manager should be handling permits. But if I leave it to him we'll lose another month, and I can't afford that with the VP shortlist conversation supposedly happening in Q3.

Lotte and I were supposed to go to Bruges for the weekend. She booked a hotel with a rooftop terrace and a Michelin-star restaurant for Saturday night. I told her I'd need to work Saturday morning and she went quiet in that way she does. Not angry, just — recalibrating. She went anyway, took her friend Anneke. I stayed home and spent the day on a laptop in my bathrobe eating cheese toast. By four o'clock I realised the permit issue was probably going to take another two weeks regardless of whether I spent Saturday on it or not.

I could have been in Bruges. I could have been sitting on a rooftop with a glass of something excellent, watching the sun go down with the person I like most in the world. Instead I ate cheese toast. I don't know what to do with that information.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for you to have gone to Bruges instead?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-07-08

Lotte showed me photos from Bruges. The terrace, the food, the canal at sunset. She wasn't rubbing it in — she just wanted to share. I looked at the photos and felt something I can only describe as stupid. Not sad. Stupid.

## Entry 8 - 2025-07-15

Permits came through. Both coordinators start Monday and the fit-out begins next week. I walked the Antwerp floor this morning and rearranged the staging layout myself because the site manager's plan was going to create a bottleneck at dock three. He didn't love me overriding him but he'll see the throughput numbers in two weeks and come around.

Took Friday off. Actually took it off — phone in a drawer, sailed out to the Grevelingenmeer with nobody but the cats in my head for company. Grilled fish on the dock afterwards, drank a cold Riesling, watched the light change on the water for an hour. Didn't think about Kramer or permits or throughput once. Well, maybe once. Lotte would be proud. Didn't tell her about the once.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned the phone in the drawer like it was a big deal. Was it?"

**Response:** Yes. I check it probably forty times a day on weekends. Old habit from when I was on-call as a shift lead. Now it's just control.

## Entry 9 - 2025-07-18

VP shortlist leaked. Three names. I'm one of them. Kramer is not, which should make me feel vindicated but instead I just feel the weight of it. If I get this, I'm responsible for all five regions across the Benelux. Sixty direct reports through my managers. A seat at the executive table. Everything I've been manoeuvring towards for years.

But there's a clause in the offer framework that the role is based in Amsterdam and requires eighty percent in-office. Lotte's business is in Rotterdam. The canal house is in Rotterdam. The boat is twenty minutes from Rotterdam. I'd be commuting two hours a day or we'd need a second flat in Amsterdam, which means I'd be living half my life in a box near Zuidas eating takeaway alone while Lotte hosts wine tastings without me.

I keep doing the maths in my head. More status, more scope, more say in how the company runs. But also more time in transit, fewer evenings on the terrace, fewer dinners where Lotte pairs a wine so perfect it changes the conversation. I don't know how you weigh those things against each other. Every time I think I've decided, I flip. Lotte hasn't said what she thinks yet. I think she's waiting to see what I actually want before she tells me what she wants, and honestly that scares me more than the interview.

**Nudge:** "If Lotte told you she wanted you to take it, would that make it easier or harder?"

**Response:** Harder. Because then I couldn't blame the decision on protecting what we have. I'd have to admit I want it and deal with what that costs.
