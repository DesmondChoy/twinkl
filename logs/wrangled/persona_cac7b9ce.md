## Entry 0 - 2025-11-13

Made the kheer for Amma's birthday exactly how Nani used to make it. The cardamom from the Indian shop on Belgrave Road, not the supermarket stuff. Sat there stirring for forty-five minutes, watching the milk thicken, and it felt right. Like the kitchen back home, like Nani's hands guiding mine when I was eight years old and barely tall enough to reach the stove.

Called Amma after. She cried a little when I described the smell. Said she could almost taste it through the phone. She asked when I was coming next, and I told her maybe Diwali if I can get the time off. She said she will save her sari for me to help her drape it, like I always do.

**Nudge:** "What is it about draping the sari together?"

**Response:** It is the only time I feel like her daughter again, not just someone who calls and sends money. She cannot do the pleats properly anymore, her hands shake. But she waits for me instead of asking the neighbour. It is our thing.

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-19

Double shift again because Meena called in sick. I do not mind covering, but by hour fourteen my feet were just throbbing and I kept thinking about how I had promised to video call Appa before his morning walk. He waits by the phone like a child waiting for sweets. I texted him instead, said I was still at work, and he just replied "okay beta" with that period at the end that always makes me feel like I have disappointed him even when he says nothing is wrong.

Reena stopped by the nurses' station around two in the morning with tea. She said I look tired, which is her way of saying I look like death. I laughed it off, but she is right. I have been covering too many shifts. The money is good—I put extra aside for Meera's wedding fund this month—but I cannot remember the last time I sat down for a proper meal that was not eaten standing in the break room.

The new doctor on rotation asked why I work so much. I did not know how to explain that it is not really a choice. My brother's shop in Ahmedabad is struggling, my parents' medical bills keep growing, and Meera's wedding will not pay for itself. This is what daughters do. But then I missed the call with Appa, and I wonder if I am getting the balance wrong. He will not be around forever, and I keep choosing the extra shifts.

**Nudge:** "Do you actually think you're getting it wrong, or is that the exhaustion talking?"

**Response:** Both, maybe. Sometimes I think the money is the excuse. Easier to send the transfer than to sit with the silence on the phone when Appa forgets what he was saying mid-sentence. The shifts fill the time I would otherwise spend worrying.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-25

Sunita auntie came over uninvited, which is very her. She brought that horrible orange mithai from the temple and sat in my kitchen for two hours talking about how her nephew just got married to "a good Gujarati girl." Then she looked at Meera's photo on the fridge and asked if there was "any news."

I told her Meera is focusing on her career right now, and Sunita auntie made that face. The one where her eyebrows go up and she says "career is good, but..." I just kept refilling her chai until she left. Did not argue, did not defend. Just smiled and nodded because that is what you do. And honestly, I was not even angry. This is just how aunties are. Meera will find someone when Meera finds someone, and no amount of auntie pressure will change that. I have made my peace with it even if they have not.

**Nudge:** "How did you get to that peace?"

**Response:** Watching Meera with her patients. She is good at what she does, really good. I did not have that when I was her age—I went into nursing because my mother did and her mother did. Meera chose it. That matters more than a wedding date.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-28

Hospital was busy with the usual winter rush. Three admissions on my shift, two respiratory cases and one fall. Paperwork took longer than the actual care, which is frustrating but normal. The new electronic system is meant to make things faster but everyone is still learning it.

Brought leftover rotli from yesterday for lunch. Ate at my desk while filling in charts. Raj called to say he would be late picking up the groceries so I stopped at Tesco on the way home. Nothing interesting, just milk and bread and the biscuits Appa likes for when he visits next.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-02

Back-to-back shifts this week. Monday bled into Tuesday and now it is whatever day it is. Slept for four hours between them and dreamed I was still at work, which felt cruel. Woke up confused about whether the patient in room 4B had actually been discharged or if I had just imagined it in the dream.

Made daal for dinner because it is the only thing that requires no thought. Watched something on telly but could not tell you what. Raj asked if I wanted to go for the walk we used to take around the park but I just wanted to sit. He sat with me instead. Neither of us said much. Sometimes that is enough.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-03

Skipped the temple this morning. Told Raj I was too tired, which was true, but also I just did not feel like sitting through the puja with everyone asking about the family and when we are going to India next. Felt guilty about it all day.

**Nudge:** "What's the guilt actually about?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-08

Had a patient today who reminded me why I do this. Mrs. Okonkwo, eighty-three, recovering from a hip replacement. Her family is all in Nigeria and she kept asking when someone would come. I sat with her during my break, just talking about nothing—the food, the weather, whether the NHS would survive another winter. She held my hand and called me "daughter."

I know I cannot replace her actual children, but I can be there for the fifteen minutes between her medication rounds. Brought her a cup of chai from the nurses' station even though it is not exactly protocol. She said it reminded her of something her mother used to make. We are not so different, Mrs. Okonkwo and I. Both far from home, both making do.

**Nudge:** "What does 'making do' look like for you?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-09

Had the conversation with Meera about Canada again. She has a job offer in Toronto, a good one, at a hospital that specializes in what she wants to do. I should be proud, and I am proud, but I also spent the whole dinner feeling like I was swallowing something sharp every time she talked about visa applications and apartment hunting.

She said I was being quiet and I said I was just tired. Which was not a lie, but it was not the whole truth either. The truth is I keep thinking about how I moved to England and left my parents behind and now my daughter wants to do the same to me. It is not fair to think that way. She has every right to build her life. I did the same thing.

But Amma stayed. My grandmother stayed. All the women in our family stayed close, within calling distance, within sari-draping distance, within "come over for chai" distance. And I broke that chain when I came here, and now Meera is breaking it further, and I cannot decide if this is progress or loss. Raj says I should be happy she is ambitious. I am happy. I am also something else that does not have a word.

**Nudge:** "What's the something else?"

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-16

Meera and I cooked together this evening. She asked me to teach her the dhokla recipe, the one from my mother's side that we only make for special occasions. Said she wanted to learn before she goes. We stood in the kitchen for two hours, me showing her how to test the batter, her writing everything down in that little notebook she keeps.

She asked about Nani, questions she has never asked before. What songs she used to sing, what her hands looked like, whether she was strict or soft. I found myself telling stories I had not thought about in years. The way Nani would wake before sunrise to pray. The way she saved the best pieces of mango for the grandchildren. Meera listened like she was memorising it all, and maybe she was. Maybe this is how it continues—not by staying in the same place, but by carrying the recipes and the stories wherever you go.

**Nudge:** "Do you believe that—that carrying the stories is enough?"

**Response:** Ask me again in a year when she is actually gone.

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-17

Sent the dhokla recipe to my mother. She called immediately, laughing, saying I had written down the measurements when she never measures anything. Told her Meera made her promise to keep it exactly as written. Three generations passing the same batter between their hands.

**Nudge:** "How did it feel, sending it?"

**Response:** Like handing over something I did not know I was holding. Heavy and light at the same time.
