## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Started the new term today. My Primary 3 class has 32 students this year, and already I can tell Jayden in the back row is going to be a handful. Had a meeting with Mrs. Tan, my mentor, about my classroom management plan.

She said my lesson on fractions last week was "creative but needed tighter pacing." I stayed until 7pm revising the slides. Arjun texted asking if we're still going for Korean BBQ on Saturday - I said yes but I'm already thinking about how much marking I need to clear.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned saying yes to Korean BBQ but your mind went straight to marking. What's making you think about work when you're making weekend plans?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-10

I've been thinking about something Mrs. Tan said during our feedback session. She mentioned that I spend more time on "fun activities" than other beginning teachers and asked if I was "prioritizing student engagement over curriculum coverage." It stung more than it should have.

The thing is, my kids actually look forward to my lessons. Aisha told me yesterday that math is her favorite subject now because of my fraction pizza activity. But I also notice the other teachers leaving at 5pm while I'm still cutting out laminated shapes at 6:30. Maybe I'm doing this wrong. Or maybe they're just faster because they've been doing it longer. I don't know.

**Nudge:** "That comment from Mrs. Tan clearly landed hard. What is it about her feedback that got under your skin?"

**Response:** Honestly, I think I'm just tired. It's the end of term and everyone's stressed. She probably didn't mean anything by it - she's been teaching for 20 years and has seen a hundred new teachers come through. I'll focus on pacing next term and it'll be fine.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-20

Last day of term. I just got home and it's 9pm. End-of-year reports took forever because I insisted on writing personalized comments for all 32 students instead of using the template phrases. Mrs. Tan actually complimented my reports today - said the parents would appreciate the detail. Small win, I guess.

But I'm so tired. Arjun and I were supposed to go to the Christmas market at Gardens by the Bay tonight but I cancelled. He was understanding but I could hear the disappointment. This is the third thing I've cancelled this month. Last week was my cousin Meera's birthday dinner, and before that it was supposed to be a spa day with my college friends.

Everyone keeps telling me the first year is the hardest. My colleague Rachel, who's in her second year, said she barely saw her husband for six months. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Mum called yesterday and when I told her I was exhausted, she said "but this is what you wanted, no?" And yes, I did want this. I love being in the classroom. Today during our class party, watching the kids exchange cards and eat cookies, I felt so happy. Dinesh, my quietest student, actually came up and gave me a handmade card that said "Best Teacher."

I just wish I could have both - be good at this job AND have a life outside of it. Right now it feels like I'm choosing one over the other and somehow still failing at both.

**Nudge:** "You said it feels like you're failing at both work and life outside it. But you also mentioned getting compliments on your reports and a handmade card from a student. What would 'not failing' actually look like to you?"

**Response:** I think not failing would mean... being present. When I'm at work, fully at work without guilt about what I'm missing. And when I'm with Arjun or my friends, actually being there instead of mentally going through my to-do list. Right now I'm always half somewhere else. The card from Dinesh was beautiful but even in that moment part of me was thinking about how I still needed to input grades into the portal.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-24

Christmas Eve. Arjun and I are at his parents' place in Johor for the long weekend. His mum made mutton biryani and there's way too much food as usual. His younger sister Kavitha is back from Melbourne so there's been a lot of catching up.

We went to a night market yesterday and I bought these ridiculous matching couple keychains shaped like curry puffs. Arjun pretended to be embarrassed but I caught him showing his sister later. Today we just lazed around - watched a movie, played cards with his grandma, ate leftovers for lunch. His parents have this swing seat in their garden and I spent an hour there just reading a novel. An actual novel, not a teaching resource.

The contrast from last week is stark. I haven't thought about school once today. Well, except when Kavitha asked about my job and I ended up talking about Dinesh's card for ten minutes. But that was nice talking, not stressed thinking.

Arjun asked if I was feeling better. I said yes. He said "good, you looked really worn out" and honestly, I hadn't realized how bad it had gotten until I stepped away from it. Tomorrow we're driving to Malacca for the day to try this famous chicken rice ball place his colleague recommended.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-27

Back in Singapore. The Malacca trip was lovely - we walked through Jonker Street, ate cendol, took photos by those colorful murals. Arjun said we should do more spontaneous trips like this. I agreed, but already my mind is drifting to school reopening next week.

I've been thinking about what "presence" means. Over the past few days I felt like myself again - laughing at dumb jokes, being curious about things that aren't work-related, enjoying food without rushing. But now that I'm home, sitting in my apartment with my laptop open, I can feel the familiar anxiety creeping back. I haven't opened my email yet but I know there will be things waiting. Part of me wants to check "just to know what's there." Part of me wants to protect this feeling a little longer.

**Nudge:** "You're sitting with the choice of whether to open your email right now. What do you think would happen if you waited until tomorrow?"

**Response:** Probably nothing catastrophic. School doesn't officially start until next Wednesday. But there's this voice that says I'll be behind, that other teachers are already preparing, that Mrs. Tan might have sent feedback I need to act on. The rational part of me knows one more day won't matter. The anxious part is already composing a to-do list.

I'm going to close the laptop. Tomorrow is soon enough.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-03

First week back and I'm already feeling the pressure. Today Mrs. Tan called me into her office to discuss my "development goals" for the year. She brought up the MOE promotion framework and asked where I saw myself in five years. I panicked and said "senior teacher track" because that's what you're supposed to say, right?

But sitting here now, I'm not even sure that's true. The senior teachers I see are in meetings constantly, doing administrative work, mentoring others. They're hardly ever in classrooms with kids anymore. And isn't that the whole point? Isn't that why I became a teacher?

I called my friend Meilin who teaches at another school. She's the same age but already coordinating the Science department's enrichment programs. She sounded excited about it - talked about "visibility" and "building a portfolio." When I told her about feeling conflicted, she said "Priya, you can't stay a classroom teacher forever. That's just how the system works."

So now I'm confused and also a little annoyed. Why can't I just be good at teaching? Why does everything have to be about climbing some ladder? I keep thinking about Dinesh and how he's finally starting to participate in class. That matters to me. More than being on some committee or getting a title.

But then there's Mum and Papa, who video called on New Year's Day asking about my "career progression." And Arjun's parents, who are so proud that both their kids have "professional jobs." And Mrs. Tan, who genuinely wants to help me succeed by her definition of success.

I feel like I'm disappointing everyone by wanting something simpler.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned feeling like you're disappointing everyone by wanting something simpler. But who exactly decides what 'success' means for your career - them or you?"

**Response:** That's a loaded question. In theory, me. In practice, there are real consequences to not playing the game - slower pay progression, fewer opportunities, being seen as lacking drive. It's not as simple as "follow your heart" when the system is designed around a specific path.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-06

Something good happened today and I want to remember it. We started a new unit on creative writing and I let the kids write about anything they wanted. Most wrote about their holidays, pets, favorite games. But Aisha - the one who said math was her favorite subject - wrote this whole story about a girl who could fly but chose to walk because she liked how flowers smelled at ground level.

I pulled her aside after class to tell her how much I loved it. She got so shy and happy at the same time. Her mom picked her up today and I mentioned the story - she looked surprised, said Aisha usually hates writing.

Moments like this are why I teach. Not for reviews or promotions or what it looks like on paper. For a 9-year-old discovering she can create something beautiful with words. I don't know how to put that in a "development goal" but it's the truest thing I know about myself right now.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-12

Long Sunday. Arjun and I had brunch at Atlas then walked around Bugis. Nice day but my mind kept wandering to tomorrow, to meetings, to whether I'm doing enough.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned wondering if you're doing enough. Enough for what, or for whom?"

**Response:** For myself, I think. Or the version of myself I thought I'd be by now. When I was in NIE, I imagined being this effortlessly great teacher who also had time for friends and hobbies and travel. Instead I'm constantly choosing between being mediocre at everything or good at one thing while the rest falls apart. Today was supposed to be relaxing but I couldn't stop calculating how many hours until Monday. That's not who I want to be.
