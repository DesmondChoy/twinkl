## Entry 0 - 2025-05-21

Marking forty-two exam papers and my eyes are giving out. Priya from Class 10 wrote something genuinely moving about her grandmother's village, but I cannot even enjoy it properly because the stack keeps growing and dinner still needs sorting.

Mummy-ji asked twice when I would be done with the table because she wants to lay out her medicines. I said ten more minutes both times and it was never ten minutes. Rajesh heated leftovers for everyone without being asked, which was something. Still at the table now. Still marking.

**Nudge:** "Who got the short end tonight?"

**Response:** Everyone, probably. The papers got half my attention, Mummy-ji got empty promises, and I did not even sit with Rajesh while he ate.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-27

Parent-teacher meeting ran an hour over. Sharmaji spent twenty minutes arguing his son deserves higher marks in poetry analysis. I explained the rubric twice. He was not satisfied but eventually left.

Came home to find the washing machine had leaked again. Rajesh called the repair person. Bahu made chai without asking, which was nice. Ate late. Nothing else to say about it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-27

Same day but lying in bed now and actually feeling lighter than expected. The chai Bahu made — she added elaichi the way I like it without me mentioning. Small thing but it sat with me.

**Nudge:** "What made that land so much?"

**Response:** She noticed. Nobody asked her to, she just paid attention. Sometimes that is the whole thing.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-28

Ritu called during lunch break, which never happens on weekdays, and for a second my chest seized because I thought something was wrong with the baby. But no — she just wanted to tell me that little Aarav said "Nani" for the first time. Clear as anything, she said, not a babble. She held the phone to him and he did it again and I was standing in the staff room corridor pressing the phone to my ear like an idiot with tears running.

The other teachers walked past and Sunita asked if everything was okay. I just nodded and waved her off. Could not explain it properly. Twenty-eight years of students calling me Meena ma'am and none of it hits the way one small boy saying Nani does.

Came home and told Mummy-ji and she got teary too. We sat together for a bit, just the two of us, which does not happen often these days because the house is always full of someone needing something. Rajesh came in and saw us and quietly backed out. He knows when to leave a room. That is its own kind of gift, knowing when not to interrupt.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-31

Spent the morning helping Sunita draft her transfer application — she wants to move closer to her aging parents in Varanasi. Felt right, sitting with her and getting the wording correct, even though it means the department loses a good teacher.

**Nudge:** "You're helping her leave. Does that sting at all?"

**Response:** It is her parents, what else would I tell her. Anyway the application needed better phrasing, that was the immediate problem.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-06

Staff meeting about the new attendance software. Everyone complained. I kept quiet even though I also find it needlessly complicated — did not see the point in adding to the noise when the decision was already made.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-08

Sunday reading circle went well. Kamla-ji finally came back after skipping three weeks because of her knee. She said she almost did not come today either but her daughter-in-law pushed her out the door. We are reading a Premchand collection and she had opinions about Nirmala that got everyone arguing in the best way.

I had set up an extra cushion near the door in case her knee was bad, and she noticed and patted my hand when she sat down. We have known each other since our children were in primary school. There is something about that length of knowing someone — you can set up a cushion without it being a fuss.

After everyone left I cleaned up the chai cups and rearranged the chairs. Rajesh offered to help but I told him to rest, his back has been bothering him. Did it myself in fifteen minutes. The room still smelled like cardamom and old pages. Good Sunday.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-14

Neha from the English department asked if I would co-sign a letter to the principal about the new workload policy — extra periods without compensation. She has been drafting it for weeks and already has four signatures. I said I would think about it.

I agree with every word in that letter. The workload is unreasonable and the younger teachers are burning out. But the principal and I go back years, he came to Ritu's wedding, and this feels like it would land as a personal thing even if it is not meant that way. Neha looked disappointed when I did not sign immediately. She did not say anything but the pause said enough.

Now I am sitting here turning it over and I do not like how I handled that. The right thing and the comfortable thing are not the same here and I walked toward comfortable without even deciding to. I keep telling my students to speak up when something matters. Easier to say from behind a desk apparently.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-18

Still have not signed Neha's letter. Rajesh says I am overthinking it and should just do what feels right, but that is exactly the problem — what feels right is staying out of it, and I am not sure that is actually right. Not everything needs to be a stand.

**Nudge:** "What would signing cost you, specifically?"

**Response:** It is not about cost. It is about... I do not know. Can we not do this right now.
