## Profile
- **Persona ID:** e448979e
- **Name:** Nadia Hussain
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** South Asian
- **Core Values:** Power
- **Bio:** Nadia Hussain is a 21-year-old stay-at-home mother of a toddler in Karachi, married at nineteen to her husband Farhan, who works long shifts at his family's garment export business. She was a class prefect and debate champion through school, accustomed to being the one people deferred to, and the transition to managing a household under her mother-in-law's roof has left her navigating a constant undercurrent of who actually runs the home. She keeps a running mental inventory of every instance someone overrides her decisions about her daughter's meals, nap schedule, or clothing, and has started an Instagram page reviewing baby products where she can set the terms and build a small following that listens to her.

## Entry 0 - 2025-03-15

Zara had her eighteen-month checkup today. Doctor said weight and height are both tracking well. I'd been worried because Ammi kept saying she looks thin, that I'm not feeding her enough roti, the usual. The doctor didn't say any of that. She said the diet plan I put together is fine.

Came home, made aloo paratha for lunch, put Zara down for her nap. Farhan called during his break. He wants his cousin's family to come for dinner on Friday. I told him fine but I'm deciding the menu, not his mother. He laughed like I was joking. I wasn't.

Spent the afternoon editing two product review posts. One got decent engagement — forty-seven likes, twelve comments. Not much by any standard but the comments were real questions from other mothers asking my opinion on the brand. That part felt good.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-22

So apparently Ammi decided to rearrange Zara's entire wardrobe while I was out getting groceries this morning. When I came back, all the drawers were different. She'd sorted everything by fabric weight — cotton in one drawer, winter things in another — and thrown out two outfits she decided were "too tight." One of them I'd bought last week.

I didn't even know what to say. Farhan was at work. I just stood in the nursery holding the grocery bags and looking at it. She came up behind me and said "I organized it properly, it was a mess." Like she was doing me a favor. Like the way I had it was wrong and she was correcting it.

I wanted to say this is my daughter's room, these are her clothes, and I decide what goes where. But what actually came out was "okay, thank you." Because what happens if I push back? She tells Farhan. Farhan tells me to keep the peace. His father gives me that look at dinner. And then everyone acts like I'm the one creating problems in the house.

It's such a small thing. Drawers. Clothes. But it wasn't about the clothes. It was about the fact that she walked into that room and rearranged it without even asking me. Like my choices in my own daughter's room need her approval.

**Nudge:** "What would it have cost you to say what you were actually thinking?"

**Response:** It's not about what it would cost me. It's about the fact that I shouldn't have to fight for something this basic. Every house has a pecking order, that's just how joint family works. I know that. But knowing it and being fine with it are two different things.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-29

Needed Farhan to transfer money for Zara's follow-up appointment. He said he'd do it after work. After work became after dinner. After dinner became "I'll do it in the morning." I asked three times. It's his card linked to the account. I can't just do it myself. Sat there watching the clock feeling completely stuck.

**Nudge:** "Is this about the money or about needing to wait?"

**Response:** Both. Neither. It's about the fact that something that matters to me — my daughter's appointment — depends on someone else remembering to press a button on their phone. And I just have to sit and hope they get around to it. That's the part that makes my jaw tight.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-03

Had a good morning. A mother from my Instagram DMs asked if I'd be open to doing a live session reviewing the new Chicco stroller — she has ten thousand followers and wanted to collab. I said yes immediately.

Spent the afternoon prepping talking points, researching the specs, writing out comparison notes against the other two strollers I've reviewed. When I know my material, I know it. Nobody needs to hand me a script.

Ammi asked what I was doing on my phone all afternoon. I said "work." She gave me that look but didn't push it. Farhan actually told her later that my page is "doing well" which is the most he's ever acknowledged it. Small win. But I'll take it because I built that page from nothing — every photo, every caption, every reply to every comment. That's mine.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-04

The dinner with Farhan's cousin happened. I'd planned the whole menu — mutton karahi, raita, kheer for dessert. Had the ingredients out by noon, started prep early so I could plate everything properly before they arrived.

Then Ammi came into the kitchen around four and just started making her own daal and a salad. Didn't ask. Didn't check with me. Just walked in and started chopping onions. When I said I had the menu handled, she said "it's not enough dishes for guests, they'll think we're not hospitable."

So we served her food too, and of course the cousin's wife complimented the daal specifically. Ammi smiled. I smiled. Nobody mentioned the karahi. I cleared the table afterward and Farhan told me "dinner was nice" like it was all one collective effort. It wasn't.

I know I should just let it go. I didn't. Still haven't.

**Nudge:** "What's the part you can't let go of?"

**Response:** I think it's that nobody noticed the difference between what I did and what she added. Like my effort and her last-minute addition were equal. I planned for hours. She walked in and overrode me in twenty minutes. And the worst part is maybe she was right — maybe the table did look better with more dishes. But that doesn't change the fact that she didn't ask. And nobody saw that it mattered to me. I keep thinking about Ammi ji walking in and just starting to chop. Like the kitchen was hers. It still is, isn't it. That's the thing I can't let go of.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-06

Farhan's abba made a comment at chai today. We were talking about schools — Zara is still over a year away from nursery but I've already been researching options, visiting campuses on my own, making a shortlist. I was explaining why I liked Beaconhouse over the closer option and he just looked at Farhan and said "let's not rush, she's still in diapers."

He wasn't even talking to me. I was mid-sentence and he redirected the conversation to his son like I wasn't sitting right there. Like the fact that I'd done the research was irrelevant because the decision will ultimately be made between the men.

And Farhan just nodded. Didn't say "actually Nadia's been looking into this" or "let's hear her out." Just nodded and changed the subject to cricket.

I went to the bedroom after and sat on the bed for a while. Zara was playing on the floor and babbling at me and I couldn't even engage with her properly because I was running the scene over and over. The look on his father's face. Not dismissive exactly — more like I simply didn't register as someone whose input counted.

I keep telling myself this is just how his generation is. But my generation is sitting right there too, not saying anything. That's the part that stings.

**Nudge:** "What would Farhan saying something have changed for you?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-12

Zara learned to say "Ammi" properly today. Not the half-syllable thing she does — actually looked at me and said it clearly. Twice. The second time she was reaching for me while Ammi was holding her, which was honestly satisfying in a way I shouldn't probably admit.

Rest of the day was normal. Laundry, feeding schedule, cleaning up after lunch. Farhan came home around seven, ate, watched something on his phone, went to sleep. We barely talked. Not fighting or anything, just the usual weeknight nothing.

I posted a reel in the evening — unboxing a diaper bag a brand sent me for free. First time getting a free product. I didn't pitch them, they found my page and reached out. Two hundred views in the first hour. Comments from women I don't know. One said she'd been waiting for someone to review that exact bag. These are strangers treating my opinion like it matters.

Funny how that works. In this house I rearrange one drawer and it gets redone. Online I recommend a product and people actually listen. Maybe that says something about the house or maybe it says something about the internet. Either way, the reel got more engagement than anything I've posted before. I screenshot the analytics before bed.

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-12

Can't sleep, writing this in bed with the phone brightness way down so Farhan doesn't wake up. Still thinking about the reel. Three hundred views now. A parenting micro-influencer with eight thousand followers commented and said "great breakdown, following." That's real. That's someone who creates content full-time validating what I put together in my living room while Zara napped.

I think the reason it feels different from anything else is that nobody handed this to me. Nobody's mother-in-law set it up. Nobody's husband transferred money so I could do it. I used the free version of a video editing app, my phone camera, and my own knowledge. Start to finish, every choice was mine. What to review, what to say, how to frame it, when to post.

And the feedback loop is immediate and clear. If people like it, the numbers go up. If they don't, they don't. There's no ambiguity, no smiling politely while someone undoes your work.

I know it's just Instagram. I know it's not a career yet. But sitting here in the dark looking at three hundred strangers who chose to watch something I made — it's the first time in a long time I feel like I'm steering something. Not asking permission. Not waiting for someone to agree. Just doing it and seeing the results. I needed that tonight.

## Entry 8 - 2025-04-15

Tuesday. Normal. Took Zara to the park in the morning. She's walking better now, holding onto my hand less. Talked to another mother there — her son is two months older than Zara. She asked where I got Zara's shoes. I told her. She asked about the brand review I posted last week. Turns out she follows my page. Didn't expect that.

Came home, gave Zara lunch, put her down. Ammi was watching a drama in the lounge. We had chai together. She asked if I'd heard from my mother, I said I'll call her this weekend. It was fine. Civil. Almost comfortable, which happens sometimes and I never know what to make of it.

Farhan brought home gulab jamun from the mithai shop near his office. Zara had a tiny piece and made a mess. I took a photo but decided not to post it — some things don't need to be content.

In the evening I went through my DMs and replied to questions about the stroller review. One woman said she bought the one I recommended and loves it. Wrote her a long reply. It's a strange feeling, being the person other people check with before spending their money. Not strange bad. Just new.

**Nudge:** "What does it feel like being the person people check with?"

**Response:** It feels normal honestly. Like how it should be. If you put in the work to learn something properly, people should listen. That's not complicated. The weird part isn't that strangers ask my opinion — the weird part is that people in my own house don't.

## Entry 9 - 2025-04-21

Farhan told his mother about a nursery school decision before telling me. I found out at dinner when she said "Farhan mentioned you're looking at Beaconhouse." He told her. Not me first. Her. About our daughter's school. I just kept eating. Didn't even look up. My hands were shaking under the table.

**Nudge:** "What were you holding back at that table?"

**Response:** I wasn't holding back. I was just eating. There's nothing to hold back when the pattern is already this clear. He talks to her. She talks to him. I find out later. That's just how information moves in this house. I'm used to it. My hands were shaking because it was cold. That's all.
