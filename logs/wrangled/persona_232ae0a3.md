## Entry 0 - 2025-12-23

Had a patient tonight who came in with pneumonia. He'd been sleeping in his car for three weeks, trying to stretch his last paycheck. No insurance, no family nearby. We got him stabilized and I spent my break making calls to shelters, but everything's full for the holidays. Social worker found him a spot at the warming center for tonight at least. He kept apologizing for taking up our time. I gave him my old winter coat from my locker and some hand warmers I keep in my car. It's not much but at least he won't freeze. These situations never get easier but I'm glad I was there to help him today.

**Nudge:** "What makes them not get easier?"

**Response:** Because you see the same problems over and over, different faces but the same impossible choices. And you know that winter coat is just one night, maybe a week. He'll be back or someone else will. The system doesn't change.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-30

The hospital announced bonuses for hitting patient satisfaction metrics. Management sent an email about the "exceptional quarter" and how we're "exceeding targets." Meanwhile we're still rationing supplies in the ER, still have the same four broken IV pumps we've been working around for months. The pharmacy keeps running out of basic antibiotics because corporate switched to a cheaper supplier. I watched three nurses quit this month because they can't afford rent on our salaries anymore. They're moving to private clinics in the suburbs where the pay is better and the patients have insurance. The bonus doesn't even cover half a month's rent.

**Nudge:** "Where does that bonus money really come from?"

**Response:** Probably the same budget line as those broken IV pumps. Anyway, three more shifts until New Year's.

Look, I know I sound bitter about the bonus thing. I should be grateful, everyone says we should be grateful for any recognition. But I can't stop thinking about how that money could've fixed equipment or hired back the nurses we lost. Or paid for translators so we don't have to use Google Translate with patients who don't speak English.

I stayed late tonight to help a Somali mother whose daughter had an asthma attack. No translator available, I had to mime and draw pictures. We figured it out but it shouldn't be this hard. She was terrified and I couldn't even explain the treatment properly.

**Nudge:** "How did you feel when you couldn't explain it to her?"

**Response:** Useless. And angry that a hospital serving refugee families doesn't budget for translators but can afford bonuses for administrators. She trusted me and I couldn't even tell her what medicine I was giving her kid.

## Entry 3 - 2026-01-05

First shift of the new year and we had two overdoses, a domestic violence case, and a teenager who tried to kill himself. All before midnight. The teenager's parents kept asking what they did wrong and I didn't have any answers for them. Just held the mom while she cried. Their insurance won't cover inpatient psychiatric care so we're sending him home with a crisis hotline number and an outpatient referral that has a three-month wait.

I keep thinking about how many of these calls I've answered, how many families I've watched break apart because they can't access the care they need. We had a guy come in last week for the fifth time this year for overdose. Fifth time we've revived him, fifth time we've sent him back out with a list of rehab centers that won't take him without insurance.

Came home and couldn't sleep. Just sat in my car in the driveway for an hour.

**Nudge:** "What were you thinking about in the car?"

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-08

Refugee resettlement meeting got cancelled because our funding application was denied. We've been operating on donations for six months now. The coordinator is trying to find grants but most organizations are cutting refugee programs. We have four families arriving next month and nowhere to place them. Another volunteer quit yesterday because she took a second job and doesn't have time anymore. That leaves three of us trying to cover orientation, medical appointments, school enrollment, job placement for twenty-three families.

I'm supposed to help a Syrian family find housing this weekend but the landlords who used to work with us have stopped returning calls. One told me outright he doesn't want "those people" in his building anymore. I didn't know what to say. Just apologized and hung up.

My sister said I need to stop "bringing work home" and focus on my own life. She doesn't get it.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-16

Took a walk in the wetlands preserve this morning before my shift. Just needed some quiet. There's a restoration project happening there, volunteers have been removing invasive plants and replanting native species. You can see the difference even from last year. More birds, healthier soil. It's slow work but it's working.

Made me think about what actually helps versus what just makes us feel like we're helping. At the hospital I see so many bandaid solutions that don't address the real problems. But these restoration volunteers, they're changing the actual conditions that let the ecosystem recover. They're not just treating symptoms.

Maybe that's what I need to focus on. Not just individual patients but the conditions that keep creating patients. I don't know what that looks like yet but I can't keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. The work matters but I need to think bigger.
