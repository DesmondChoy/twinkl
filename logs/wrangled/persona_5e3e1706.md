## Entry 0 - 2025-10-26

Another Sunday close. Jenna asked if she could leave fifteen minutes early because her roommate locked herself out and was sitting on the porch in the rain. I said yes without even thinking about it, then spent the last hour doing her side work plus mine. Not a big deal, really. She looked so stressed when she asked.

Had to explain to the district manager during his surprise visit why we were short-staffed at close. He did that thing where he nods but you can tell he's making a mental note. Whatever. Jenna got home safe. Her roommate has a key now.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-29

Tommy came in today for his shift and he was just—off. Like not making eye contact, moving slow. I pulled him aside after the morning rush, asked if everything was okay, and he told me his grandpa died over the weekend. He'd driven back from Spokane that morning and came straight to work because he didn't want to call in and mess up the schedule.

I sent him home. Told him I'd cover. And honestly it felt right. Like that's exactly what I should've done. He hugged me in the back hallway, which was kind of awkward because we'd never hugged before, but also not awkward at all. Sometimes you just do the thing you'd want someone to do for you.

**Nudge:** "How'd the rest of the shift go without him?"

**Response:** Fine. Busy but fine. Not really the point.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-04

Had the conversation with Priya today. The one I've been putting off. She asked me point-blank if she was getting promoted to key holder, and I had to tell her no. Not because she didn't deserve it—she absolutely did—but because corporate froze all promotions until Q1. I could see her face just... close off. She nodded, said she understood, but I know she didn't. How could she?

I wanted to tell her that I'd argued for her. That I'd sent three emails and sat in a forty-five minute call with regional trying to get an exception. But that felt like it would come across as making excuses, or worse, like I wanted credit for trying. So I just sat there and let her think I hadn't fought for it at all.

She took her break right after and didn't say anything to me for the rest of the shift. I keep replaying it. Should I have told her? Would it have changed anything, or just made her feel worse knowing it was out of both our hands? I genuinely don't know. I just know I feel like I let her down, even though I did everything I could. Or did I? Maybe there was another email I could've sent. Another person I could've called.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from telling her you fought for it?"

**Response:** I think I was scared she'd see through me. Like, what if I told her I tried and she could tell I didn't try hard enough? Or what if she asked what exactly I said, and I had to admit I probably could have pushed harder? Easier to just take the hit and let her think I'm the bad guy than to open up and have her confirm it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-06

District manager pulled me into a call about overtime. Apparently I've approved too many shift swaps. I told him my team has lives outside of work and sometimes things come up. He said that's not his problem.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-12

Jenna brought me a coffee this morning. Just showed up with it before her shift, said it was a thank-you for covering her that Sunday a few weeks back. It was an oat milk latte from the place down the street—the fancy one I'd mentioned once like two months ago. The fact that she remembered felt bigger than the coffee itself.

Weird how a small thing can shift your whole day. I'd been kind of dreading coming in because of all the inventory stuff, but after that I just felt lighter. Like okay, maybe the job isn't just about spreadsheets and schedule conflicts. Sometimes it's just about people noticing each other.

**Nudge:** "What was it about the inventory stuff that had you dreading it?"

**Response:** Just boring admin stuff. Takes forever. Doesn't matter now.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-13

Stayed two hours late because Maria's bus didn't come and I wasn't going to make her walk home in the dark. It's not safe. I know it's not in my job description to wait with her, but she's nineteen and her phone was dead and the next bus wasn't for an hour. So I stayed. We sat in the break room and she told me about her mom's chemo appointments and how she's been working doubles to cover the bills.

When I finally got home I just sat in my car in the parking lot for like ten minutes. I'm tired. I want to help everyone but I can't. I physically can't. There's only so many hours and so many shifts I can cover and so many late nights I can stay. But every time I say no, I feel like I'm failing someone. And saying yes is starting to feel like I'm failing myself.

**Nudge:** "What does failing yourself look like?"

**Response:** Missing things. My sister's birthday dinner last week, I had to leave early because someone called in. Meals I skip. Sleep I don't get. I keep telling myself it's temporary but I've been saying that for six months.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-19

Priya came up to me today before close and said she appreciated how I run things. That she knows I care about the team. It caught me off guard—we haven't really talked since the promotion conversation. She said she'd been offered a job at the new boba place across the street for more money, but she's staying because of how we treat people here.

I almost cried in the walk-in cooler after she left. I'm so tired. But that—that's why I do it. That's the whole reason. Knowing someone feels seen, feels like they matter. It doesn't fix the overtime problem or the district manager breathing down my neck. But it reminds me there's a point to all of this. There has to be.

**Nudge:** "What would it mean if there wasn't?"

**Response:** I don't know. Can't think about that right now.
