## Entry 0 - 2025-02-06

Long day. There was a curriculum planning session this afternoon and I'd spent most of last weekend drafting a proposal for how we should restructure the Year 9 field trip programme. I'd mapped out logistics, costs, student learning outcomes - the whole thing. I started presenting it and maybe two minutes in, Henrik just cut straight across me. Didn't even raise his hand or wait for a pause. Just started talking about his own idea for partnering with some outdoor centre his friend runs.

And then everyone just... shifted attention to him. Elsa started asking him follow-up questions. The deputy head nodded along. My slides were still up on the projector and nobody even glanced at them. I sat there holding my notes feeling like I'd been physically pushed to the side of the room. I tried to redirect once - said something like "if we could go back to the cost comparison I'd started" - but Henrik just kept going, and the deputy head said we'd "circle back" to mine later. We didn't.

I know I should have pushed harder. I know I should have said "I wasn't finished." But something about the way everyone just moved on made me feel like if I insisted, I'd look petty or desperate. And that felt worse than being ignored. So I just sat there, pretending to take notes, while Henrik got credit for a half-baked version of what I'd already done better. I'm still angry about it and I don't know what to do with that.

**Nudge:** "What felt worse - being overlooked, or the thought of how you'd look pushing back?"

**Response:** I think it's the second one, honestly. If I'd just been overlooked that's annoying but I can deal with it. It was the calculation in my head - like, if I fight for this, will they see me as someone with conviction or someone who can't handle being interrupted? And the fact that I even had to think about it made me feel small. I shouldn't have to audition for basic respect.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-10

Good day actually. Parent-teacher conferences tonight and I had back-to-back sessions for three hours straight. My voice is shot and I'm mainlining tea but I feel kind of... alive? There's something about sitting across from a parent and watching their face shift when I show them exactly where their kid improved, with specific examples, with the rubric breakdowns I put together. One mother said she wished all her daughter's teachers were as organised. Another father asked if I'd be willing to mentor his son through the IB application. I said yes before he even finished the sentence.

I don't know why these nights energise me when they exhaust everyone else. Elsa left after her first block looking like she'd run a marathon. But for me it's like - this is where it matters. This is the part where they see you actually know what you're doing. And when they see that, they trust you. And when they trust you, you can actually change things. I reorganised my class seating charts last week based on learning profiles I built myself and two parents tonight specifically mentioned that their kids are more engaged since the change. That's not nothing. That's me actually making a difference because I put myself in a position to.

Just got home. Feet hurt. Going to mark three essays and then collapse. But yeah. Good day.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-17

Submitted the budget request for the Year 9 field trip two weeks ago. Still haven't heard back. I emailed the deputy head on Wednesday, she said it needs to go through the finance committee. I asked when the committee meets. She said "when they have quorum." So basically I'm just supposed to sit here and wait while my timeline collapses.

I've already done all the work. The costing is done, the risk assessments are done, the parent consent forms are drafted. Everything is ready to go and it's being held up by people who haven't even looked at the proposal yet. I followed up again today and got a one-line reply: "We'll get to it." As if my project is some afterthought they'll squeeze in between tea breaks. It's infuriating. If they'd just give me direct access to the budget approval process I could have this sorted in a day. But no, I have to wait for someone else to decide my work is worth looking at.

**Nudge:** "Is it the delay that's getting to you, or something else?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-20

Small win today. The head of department asked me to represent our faculty at the district curriculum review panel next month. It's normally a senior teacher slot and she specifically said she chose me because my documentation is the most thorough. Two colleagues with over a decade more experience got passed over for this. I don't feel bad about that. If anything it confirms what I already suspected - that being meticulous matters more than just being around for a long time.

I've already started preparing my presentation notes even though the panel isn't for three weeks. I want to walk in there and have the most polished submission in the room. If I do this well, the district coordinators will know my name. That opens doors. That's how you go from being "the young geography teacher" to someone people actually listen to.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-20

Just came from a department meeting about the spring assessment schedule. I had a clear plan for staggering the exams but Karin pushed back hard, said it would create too much admin work, and the rest just went with her. I caved because I could feel the room turning, but her plan is worse and they'll see that in April when everything piles up.

**Nudge:** "You said you 'caved.' What would it have taken to hold your ground?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-24

New teaching assistant started today. She was assigned to support my Year 8 and Year 9 classes. Within the first hour she rearranged my resource station without asking, told a student a different method for the mapping exercise than the one I'd taught, and then during break she suggested to Elsa that my lesson pacing might be "a bit fast for some learners." Elsa told me this casually like it was helpful feedback.

I've been teaching these classes since September. I built the assessment rubrics, the differentiation frameworks, the whole progression structure. And someone who's been in the building for four hours is already second-guessing my methods to a colleague. I pulled her aside after lunch and explained how my classroom runs. She smiled and said "of course, I'm just here to help." But the damage is done - Elsa now thinks my pacing is a problem. I need to correct that impression before it spreads.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-02

District panel prep is going well. Spent the weekend refining my presentation and I'm confident it's strong. Ran through it with the head of department on Friday and she said it was "exactly the level of detail the panel looks for." She also mentioned she'd put my name forward for a cross-school working group on assessment reform that starts after Easter.

The field trip budget finally got approved too - no changes to my original figures. So all that waiting was for nothing, they just rubber-stamped what I'd submitted weeks ago. Annoying but at least it's done. Year 9 students are already asking about it. One of them told me it's the first time a teacher has organised something like this for their year group. I didn't correct her but it's true - nobody else bothered to put the work in. I did.
