I don't care what Priya thinks, I handled that IV alarm correctly. The patient was stable and I had already checked the line twice before she came over to "help." I've been on this unit for fourteen months now, I know the protocols.

**Nudge:** "What made her stepping in feel different from just helping out?"

**Response:** Because it was in front of the resident. Made me look like I didn't know what I was doing.

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-15

Still thinking about the Priya thing from earlier. I know I sounded annoyed in my last entry but there's more to it. She's been a nurse for nine years and sometimes she does this thing where she swoops in and takes over, and the doctors start looking at her for answers instead of me. I worked hard to get assigned to the step-down unit. Most new grads end up on med-surg for at least two years before they get a chance at cardiac, and I pushed for this placement because I want to be in the ICU by the time I'm twenty-five.

But here's what bugs me. When Mr. Okonkwo's wife was crying in the hallway after the cardiologist explained his prognosis, Priya was charting. I was the one who sat with Mrs. Okonkwo for twenty minutes, got her water, called her daughter. Nobody saw that. Nobody writes that in your evaluation. The doctors remember who looked competent with the IV pump, not who held someone's hand. And I did both today, but only one of those things is going to show up when they're deciding who moves to the ICU.

I'm not saying Priya's a bad nurse. She's great, actually. She taught me half of what I know about reading telemetry strips. I just wish the people making decisions about my career could see the full picture instead of whatever three-second snapshot they happened to catch.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned two things you did today — the clinical work and sitting with Mrs. Okonkwo. If you had to pick one to be known for, which would it be?"

**Response:** Both. That's the whole point. I don't want to pick. But if I'm being honest, the Mrs. Okonkwo thing is the reason I became a nurse in the first place. The ICU stuff, the certifications — that's how you get taken seriously so you can keep doing the other part. At least that's what I tell myself.

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-22

Three twelves in a row. Came home, microwaved leftover pasta, opened the CCRN study guide, and fell asleep on page four. Mom called but I let it go to voicemail. I'll call her back tomorrow.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-29

Funny day. Got pulled into a rapid response on 4 North because they were short-staffed and the charge nurse remembered me from orientation. Patient was this 80-year-old guy, former high school football coach, and even while we were stabilizing him he was trying to crack jokes about his offensive line being tougher than his heart. We got him transferred to the ICU and the attending told me I did good work. Wrote it down in my phone immediately so I don't forget the exact words — "good clinical instinct." That's going in my ICU application.

Then I got back to my floor and found out my patient in room 412, Mrs. Patel, had been asking for me the whole time I was gone. She doesn't like the other nurses because she says they talk too fast and don't explain things. I felt bad. I sat with her for an extra ten minutes at the end of my shift even though I was already in overtime. My charge nurse gave me a look but Mrs. Patel smiled and said I remind her of her granddaughter, so whatever.

**Nudge:** "You stayed late for Mrs. Patel even after the charge nurse's look. What was going through your head in that moment?"

**Response:** It wasn't a big deal. Ten minutes. She needed someone to listen.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-01

I'm so mad at myself. Mom needed me to drive her to her follow-up appointment today and I completely forgot because I swapped shifts to cover for Dana, who's going through a divorce and needed someone to take her Saturday. I've been telling everyone yes all week — yes I'll cover your shift, yes I'll precept the new grad, yes I'll sit on the unit council — and then I forgot the one thing that actually mattered.

My brother Tyler had to take the bus from school and then drive her in my car, and he's only had his license for three months. He was fine about it but Mom sounded so tired on the phone when she told me. Not angry, just tired. That's worse. If she yelled at me I could at least argue back but the quiet disappointment just sits in my chest like a rock.

The thing is, I covered for Dana because she was falling apart in the break room and I couldn't just walk away from that. And the new grad, Jess, she literally doesn't know how to titrate a drip yet and if I don't teach her someone's going to get hurt. And the unit council looks good on my resume for the ICU transfer. Every single thing I said yes to had a reason. But all those reasons don't change the fact that my mom sat in a waiting room chair that hurts her hip because I wasn't there.

I need to figure out how to stop doing this. I keep spreading myself across everyone else's emergencies and then there's nothing left for the people who were there first.

**Nudge:** "You listed the reasons for every yes. Is there one you would take back?"

**Response:** The unit council. That one was for me, not for anyone else. The rest I'd do again because people needed help. But the council meeting — I could have said next quarter. I just didn't want to lose the spot.

Called Mom after my shift ended. She said the appointment went fine, the surgeon is happy with her range of motion, and Tyler did a good job driving. She told me not to worry about it.

I ordered grocery delivery to her house for the week and signed up for a meal prep service for Tyler so he doesn't just eat ramen every night. Set a recurring reminder in my phone for all her upcoming appointments. I won't miss another one.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-02

Studied for three hours this morning before my shift. Went through the hemodynamic monitoring chapter and took a practice quiz — scored 82%, which is passing but not where I want to be. My target is 90% on every practice test before I schedule the real exam. I made flashcards for the concepts I missed and I'm going to review them on my breaks this week.

At work, had a good shift. Got assigned to a fresh post-cath patient and managed the sheath pull site without any complications. Documented everything meticulously because I know the ICU charge nurses pull charts when they're reviewing internal transfer candidates. My manager Denise mentioned that there might be an opening on the ICU in March. She didn't promise anything but she said my name had come up.

After work, drove to Mom's even though it wasn't Sunday. Tyler had a rough day at school — some issue with a group project where his partners aren't pulling their weight. I helped him outline a plan for talking to his teacher about it. He's so much like me, takes everything on himself instead of asking for help. I told him it's okay to flag when something isn't working. The irony of giving that advice was not lost on me.

**Nudge:** "What irony were you thinking of?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-07

Had coffee with Priya before shift today. She told me she's leaving — transferring to a hospital in Phoenix because her husband got a job out there. I was surprised by how much it bothered me. We're not close exactly, but she's the person I learned the most from on this unit. She said she thinks I'm ready for the ICU and that she told Denise the same thing.

I should feel good about that. And part of me does. But there's this other part that's uneasy. If Priya leaves, I'm suddenly one of the more experienced nurses on the floor, and we have two new grads starting next month. That means more precepting, more questions, more of me being the person everyone leans on. I already can't say no. What happens when there's literally no one else to ask? I keep thinking about last week, forgetting Mom's appointment because I was stretched too thin. If the workload doubles, something is going to break. I just don't know if it'll be my schedule or me.

**Nudge:** "You said something will break. What would protecting yourself look like?"

**Response:** I honestly don't know. Saying no, I guess. But saying no to a new grad who doesn't know how to read a rhythm strip feels like putting a patient at risk. And saying no to my family isn't an option. So I don't really know what's left to cut.

CCRN practice test today, scored 88%. Getting closer. Tyler's coming over for dinner tonight, I'm making Mom's enchilada recipe.

## Entry 9 - 2025-02-09

Tyler told me over dinner that he's thinking about nursing school. He said he wants to be like me. I had to go to the kitchen for a minute because I didn't want him to see me tear up. It's the best thing anyone has said to me in months and also the thing that scares me the most.

Because what does he see? He sees me working hard, yes. He sees me helping people. But does he also see the dark circles and the missed appointments and the fact that I eat most of my meals standing up in a break room? I want him to have what I have — this feeling of doing something that matters — but I want him to do it without grinding himself down the way I do. I told him I thought it was a great idea and that I'd help him look at programs. And I meant it. I just hope he's better at the balance part than I am.

**Nudge:** "What would you want him to do differently than you?"

**Response:** Ask for help before he's drowning. Take a day off without feeling guilty. Remember that being good at your job and being there for your people shouldn't be an either-or thing. Basically everything I know I should do but don't.
