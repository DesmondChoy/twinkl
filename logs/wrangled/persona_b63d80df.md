## Entry 0 - 2025-03-17

Today was the monthly temple committee meeting and I just cannot shake this strange feeling. Meena aunty said something about how "some people like to take charge of everything" and I know she was talking about me. Everyone was looking at their phones or the floor. I have been running this committee for six years and we have never had a failed event, never run out of food, never had volunteers not show up. But suddenly I am the problem?

I stayed quiet. What else could I do? If I defended myself it would look exactly like what she was accusing me of. But sitting there pretending I did not hear her felt like swallowing glass. My husband said I should just ignore it, that Meena aunty is just jealous because her daughter-in-law moved her out of the main house. Maybe. But that does not explain why no one else spoke up for me.

The thing is, I take charge because if I do not, things fall apart. Remember the Holi celebration last year when I was at Ravi's parents' house? Complete disaster. Cold food, wrong decorations, crying children. But sure, I am the one who is too controlling.

**Nudge:** "What held you back from responding?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-22

Dropped off three containers of biryani to the Sharma family down the street. Their son just had surgery and the mother looked like she had not slept in days. She cried when she saw me at the door. This is what it is all about, really. Showing up when people need you.

**Nudge:** "How did it feel when she cried?"

**Response:** Honestly, it reminded me of when Amma had her first stroke and neighbors brought us food for weeks. You never forget who showed up. I want to be that person for others. Sometimes I think this is the only thing I am truly good at.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-24

Priya came home crying from school because her friend group excluded her from a birthday party. I spent an hour consoling her but the whole time I kept thinking about that committee meeting. Is this what it feels like? To be pushed out? Too tired to think about this more.

**Nudge:** "Are you thinking about yourself or Priya?"

**Response:** Priya, obviously. She is thirteen and everything feels like the end of the world at that age. I am just tired.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-27

Ravi's sister called asking if we can host his parents for six weeks instead of two this summer. She has a work trip to Singapore that "cannot be rescheduled." I said yes before even thinking about it. What else could I say?

Now I am mentally reorganizing everything. Priya's room will have to be cleared for them. I will need to cook separate low-sodium meals for Appa. The bathroom schedule becomes a nightmare with seven people. But Lakshmi made it sound like I was the only solution, and I suppose I am.

**Nudge:** "Did you want to say something else?"

**Response:** Wanting and doing are different things. Lakshmi works, I do not. She has meetings in Singapore, I have school drop-offs. The math is simple. But yes, fine, I wanted to say "let me check with Ravi first" like a normal person. Instead I just absorbed it like always.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-01

Nothing happened today, just the usual. But I have been thinking about something my cousin Anita said when she visited last month. She asked why I "gave up" my career to stay home, as if I am sitting here watching television all day. I manage a household, a family, a community. I coordinate schedules for five people, handle three different school systems' requirements, manage all the finances, plan every festival, and support whoever needs me.

Ravi could not find his passport last week. Who found it in twenty minutes? Me. Priya needed a costume for her Bharatanatyam recital. Who stayed up sewing until midnight? Me. Vikram's college applications needed someone to proofread seven essays. Me.

But because there is no salary, it is not real work. Because I do not have a LinkedIn profile anymore, I have "given up." Anita has a corner office and takes two vacations a year. Good for her. She also calls her mother once a month and sends birthday cards late. I am not saying one is better. I am just saying they are different, and I am tired of having to defend my choice.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-04

Committee met again. I volunteered to step back from leading the Navratri planning. Let someone else handle the vendor contracts and volunteer schedules. Meena aunty looked surprised. Everyone did, actually.

**Nudge:** "How did it feel to step back?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-11

Made chai for myself this afternoon and sat on the balcony for fifteen minutes doing nothing. The house was quiet. Just me and the crows arguing in the mango tree. Cannot remember the last time I did this.

**Nudge:** "What made today different?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-16

Vikram called from university just to talk. Not because he needed money or help with something. Just to tell me about his professor who reminds him of his grandfather, and about the dosa place he found near campus. We talked for forty-five minutes.

I think I did something right with him. He is kind. He notices people. Last month he organized a food drive at his dorm because he saw international students struggling during spring break when the dining hall closed. He did not tell me about it - his roommate's mother mentioned it. That is the part that makes me proudest. He does not do it for recognition.

**Nudge:** "What do you think shaped him that way?"

**Response:** I wish I could take credit but honestly, I think he just watched. Watched me drop off food to the Sharmas. Watched his grandmother live with us for three years. Watched Ravi stay late at office but still make every recital and cricket match. Children learn what they see, not what you tell them.

## Entry 8 - 2025-04-16

Second entry today. In-laws arrived this evening, four days early. Lakshmi's flight got moved up. I had just finished cleaning but the guest room mattress has not been aired. Amma looked at the sheets and I know she noticed. Too tired to care right now.

## Entry 9 - 2025-04-20

Amma has been here four days and I am already losing my mind. She reorganized my spice cabinet. MY spice cabinet that I have arranged the same way for fifteen years. She said she was "helping" because it was "inefficient." I have managed three children, a husband, a house, and an entire temple committee with that "inefficient" cabinet.

I did not say anything. What would be the point? She is seventy-two and she is a guest. But Ravi saw my face when I opened the cabinet door and he just shrugged. Shrugged! As if his mother rearranging my kitchen is completely normal and I should just accept it.

The worst part is that she is not wrong. Her arrangement probably is more efficient. But that is not the point. The point is that this is my home, my space, the one domain where I should have some say. But apparently even here I am meant to just smile and adjust. I made everyone's favorite dinner anyway because what else am I going to do, let everyone starve over cumin placement?

**Nudge:** "What would having a say look like?"

**Response:** It does not matter. Four more weeks and then things go back to normal. I just need to survive until then.

## Entry 10 - 2025-04-24

Priya asked me today why I always have to be "in charge of everything." She was annoyed because I reminded her three times about her homework. Three times! Because she was on her phone and the deadline was in two hours. But apparently I am controlling.

I told her that someone has to keep track of things. She rolled her eyes and said "you could just let me fail once." What kind of mother lets her child fail on purpose? I did not hover over Vikram and look how he turned out - responsible, organized, successful. But Priya is different. She needs more reminders. If I do not push her, she will coast.

Ravi thinks I should "give her space." Easy for him to say. He is at office twelve hours a day. He does not see the daily negotiation of getting this child to do anything. When she fails a test, no one will ask where her father was. They will ask what I was doing.

But maybe everyone is right and I am the problem. Maybe I should just stop caring. Let the laundry pile up, let the homework go undone, let the spice cabinet stay however Amma wants it. Then we will see how things run.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you did stop?"

**Response:** Chaos. Or maybe nothing. Maybe everything would be fine and I would realize I have been making myself essential when I am actually just in the way. That thought is worse than the chaos, honestly.

## Entry 11 - 2025-04-27

Amma and I had an argument today. Or not an argument exactly - she does not argue. She just makes observations. "In my house we always did it this way." "You work so hard, beta, but maybe if you organized differently..." "Priya seems stressed, have you thought about letting her breathe?"

I finally said something. I told her that I appreciate her concern but this is my house and my family and I have been managing fine for twenty years. She got very quiet and went to her room. Ravi says I was too harsh. Maybe. But she has been here two weeks and every day there is a new suggestion, a new correction, a new way I am falling short.

The thing is, she ran her own household for forty years. I understand the need to feel useful, to have a role. When she moved in with Lakshmi she lost all of that. So she comes here and tries to find her place by improving mine. I see the pattern. I am not blind to it.

But seeing the pattern does not make it easier to live with. And I keep wondering - is this my future? Will I be the mother-in-law who cannot stop fixing things because fixing things is all I know how to do? Will Priya write journal entries about me reorganizing her kitchen?

**Nudge:** "What would you want to be remembered for?"

**Response:** Not for being right. Not for having the most organized spice cabinet or the best-run committee. I want Vikram and Priya and even little Arun to remember that I showed up. That when things fell apart, I was there. That I fed people not because I needed to control the menu but because I believe you cannot love someone properly if you let them go hungry. That is why I do all of this. I think I forgot that somewhere along the way.
