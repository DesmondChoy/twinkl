# Persona b12682c6: Gerrit van der Berg

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** b12682c6
- **Name:** Gerrit van der Berg
- **Age:** 45-54
- **Profession:** Gig Worker
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Tradition
- **Bio:** Gerrit is a 51-year-old Dutch man who works as a freelance delivery driver and occasional handyman through various platform apps in Rotterdam. He grew up in a tight-knit Reformed Protestant family in Zeeland, where his father ran a small fishing supply shop for forty years. After the shop closed and his marriage ended, Gerrit drifted into gig work for the flexibility to care for his elderly mother. He still attends the same church denomination his family has belonged to for generations, drives back to Zeeland for Sunday dinners when he can, and keeps his father's old shop sign mounted above his apartment door. He is increasingly aware of the gap between the rooted life he was raised to expect and the precarious, algorithm-driven existence he actually leads.

Spent most of the day doing Deliveroo runs in the rain. The app kept sending me to Kralingen and back, which eats petrol. Made about seventy euros after costs. Not terrible, not good.

Drove past the old Fenix warehouse on the way home. They've turned it into some kind of food hall now. Mam and I used to go there when I was small — it was still a working warehouse then, real dockworkers loading ships. She'd bring me along when she visited Tante Lien. Strange seeing the same walls but everything inside different. The bones are there but the life has changed.

Called Mam tonight. She asked when I'm coming for Sunday. Told her this week looks difficult because of a booking in Dordrecht. She didn't say anything but the silence was louder than words.

**Nudge:** "What was it about that warehouse that stayed with you?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-22

Long day. Did a furniture assembly job in Capelle through Werkspot, then four hours of deliveries in the evening. My back is killing me. Should probably see someone about it but I don't have the coverage for a physiotherapist right now. The basic insurance only goes so far.

Had a strange moment at the assembly job. The couple who hired me — young, maybe early thirties — they were hanging family photos on the wall of their new flat. Grandparents, wedding photos, kids at christenings. The man said something about wanting the living room to feel like his grandmother's house. I understood that completely. But then he also had this app controlling all the lights and the thermostat and I thought, you can't have your oma's living room run by a computer. It doesn't work like that.

Too tired to think about it more. Eating leftover stamppot and going to bed.

**Nudge:** "Sounds like that bothered you more than just being tired."

**Response:** Maybe. It's not about the smart lights, really. It's that everyone wants the feeling of the old way without actually living it. They want the photos on the wall and the gezelligheid but they also want the algorithm to set the temperature. You can't curate warmth. My grandmother's house was warm because she was there all day, baking, mending, talking to the neighbours. It wasn't a setting you could select. I think what bothers me is that I understand the impulse — I want it too — but I can see it slipping into something hollow. And I'm not sure I'm doing any better. I drive around all day for an app. My father would not have understood this life at all.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-22

Can't sleep so writing again. Mind is jumping around. Listened to a recording of the Zeeland dialect my cousin Jaap posted in the family WhatsApp group — some old farmer telling a story about the flood of '53. My grandfather survived that flood. He never talked about it directly but it shaped everything about how he lived afterward. Every decision was about making sure the family had solid ground.

That's what I keep coming back to. Solid ground. My grandfather rebuilt after the water took the house. My father kept the shop going for four decades in the same spot. And here I am checking an app to see if someone in Rotterdam-Zuid wants their Pad Thai delivered before it gets cold.

But tonight something small happened that felt right. One of my regular delivery customers — an old woman on Nieuwe Binnenweg — she recognised me and asked me to come in for a moment. She'd made a pot of coffee and had nobody to drink it with. I said I had five minutes. We talked about the weather and she showed me a photo of her late husband. I was fifteen minutes late on my next delivery and got a warning from the app. Don't care.

Sitting with her felt like the most honest thing I'd done all week. Like something my father would have done without even thinking about it.

Missed Koningsdag with the family because I took a full day of bookings. Needed the money. Mam sent photos of everyone at Uncle Willem's — the kids in orange, Opa's flag on the pole like always. My niece asked where I was. I hate that she had to ask. I should have been there. The money isn't worth what I gave up.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-03

Saturday. Drove to Zeeland after my morning shifts. Made it in time for coffee and cake at Mam's. She'd kept the leftover appeltaart from Wednesday's church group. We sat in the kitchen and she told me stories about Dad fixing the shop's awning every spring. Fell asleep on her couch before dinner. Woke up feeling more rested than I have in weeks.

**Nudge:** "What was different about that rest?"

**Response:** It's the house. The sounds. The clock in the hall that's been ticking since before I was born. Mam's radio on low in the kitchen. No notifications, no app telling me where to go next. Just the shape of a day I recognise from childhood. My body knows how to rest there because nothing in that house is trying to get my attention. Everything is just where it's been for thirty years.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-07

Had a conversation with my ex-wife Anneke today. She called about logistics for our son Bram's birthday next week. Bram's turning twenty-two. We kept it practical — who's bringing what, what time, where. But at the end she said something that stuck. She said, "You sound tired, Gerrit. Not just body tired."

She's not wrong. I've been thinking about what my life looks like from the outside and whether it matches what I thought it would be at this age. My father at fifty-one had the shop, the house, the family under one roof, the church council seat. He knew where he'd be every day for the next ten years. I don't know where I'll be next Tuesday.

I'm not envious exactly. He also had worries I don't have — inventory, rent, employees. But he had a shape to his life. A pattern you could trace. Mine feels like scattered dots.

The strange part is that within the gig work there are small rituals I've built. Same route through Delfshaven in the mornings. Same café for my break. Same nod to the guy at the parking garage. It's not nothing. But it's not the same as what was handed down to me. I'm making something, but I can't tell yet if it holds.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for those rituals to feel like enough?"

**Response:** Honestly, I think it would take other people sharing them. My father's routines meant something because the whole family moved through them together. Opening the shop, closing the shop, dinner at six, church on Sunday — these weren't just his habits, they were ours. My café stop in Delfshaven is mine alone. Nobody notices if I skip it. That's the difference. A ritual that only you observe is just a habit. I think for it to hold, someone else would have to care whether I kept it or not.

Bram's birthday dinner tonight. Anneke organised it at that Indonesian place he likes. We were all there — Anneke, her partner Maarten, Bram, Bram's girlfriend, me. Could have been awkward. Wasn't, really.

Bram asked me to say grace before the meal. Nobody else at the table does that anymore. Anneke looked surprised. Maarten looked at his plate. But Bram asked, so I did. Kept it short. Thanked God for the food and for Bram being healthy and here with us. My voice cracked a bit on the last part but I don't think anyone noticed.

After dinner, Bram walked me to my car and said, "Thanks for doing that, Pa. Oma would have liked it." He's right. She would have. That one sentence carried me all the way home.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-12

Got a notification today that Deliveroo is changing the payment structure again. Lower base rate, higher "surge" bonuses. Which means they want us competing against each other for the busy slots instead of earning a steady amount. Every few months they adjust something and we just have to absorb it. There's no negotiation. There's no union rep to call. There's a feedback form that goes nowhere.

My father would have walked out. He walked out of a supplier deal once because the man changed the terms after a handshake. Said if a man's word doesn't hold, his product won't either. That was the end of it. He found another supplier that afternoon. I can't find another Deliveroo. I mean, I can switch to Uber Eats or Thuisbezorgd, but they all do the same thing. There's no door to walk out of because there are no walls — just an app you log into.

I talked to another driver at the pickup point about it. He shrugged. He's twenty-four. He doesn't think about it the way I do. For him this is temporary — a step between university and a real job. For me this is the job. This is Monday. This is how I pay rent.

I'm not angry at him. I'm angry that I'm fifty-one and standing in the same spot as a twenty-four-year-old with a completely different horizon. We're doing the same work but living in different stories.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-13

Went to church this morning. Not my usual one in Rotterdam — I drove to Zeeland for the service at the old church in Goes. Sat in the same pew where my family has sat for as long as anyone remembers. Third row, left side, near the pillar.

Pastor de Vries preached about the parable of the sower. Seeds on rocky ground, seeds among thorns, seeds in good soil. I've heard it a hundred times. But this time I thought about it differently. The rocky ground isn't always a place — sometimes it's a season. Sometimes the soil is fine but the weather is wrong. You still plant.

After the service, old Meneer Bakker shook my hand and asked about my mother. Said he remembered my father fondly. "A man who kept his word and kept his shop clean." That's two things, but they capture Dad pretty well.

Drove back to Rotterdam in the afternoon. The highway was busy, everyone returning from the weekend. I had a delivery booking at four but I took the long route through the country roads instead, past the fields and the old dykes. Got to Rotterdam ten minutes late. Didn't rush.

I don't have the life my father had. I might never have it. But I can still sit in that pew and drive those roads and remember that the ground under all of this is the same ground. It doesn't move, even when I do.

**Nudge:** "What does that ground hold for you right now?"

**Response:** Family. The language. The church. The way Mam still sets the table the same way every Sunday. The fact that Bram asked me to say grace, which means something got passed along even through the mess of the divorce and the years I wasn't fully present. The ground is whatever doesn't change based on what app I open or what rate I get paid. It's the part of me that existed before any of this and will still be there after. I can't always stand on it — sometimes I'm too far away, too busy, too caught up in the week. But knowing it's there is what keeps me from feeling completely adrift.
