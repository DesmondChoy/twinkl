## Entry 0 - 2025-03-31

Got the async handler working today. Took me three days of reading documentation and watching my screen like it owed me money, but when those tests finally went green, I stood up and made myself a cup of tea. Just stood there in the kitchen, holding the warm mug, looking out at the grey Berlin sky.

Lukas, one of the junior devs, sent a thumbs-up emoji in Slack when he saw my commit. He has no idea what that little green checkmark cost me. But that is fine. I know.

**Nudge:** "What did it feel like, standing there with the tea?"

**Response:** Like I had earned five minutes of quiet. Not celebration, just stillness after fighting something.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-07

Spent most of the day in meetings. Sprint planning, architecture review, a call with the client about edge cases nobody had thought about. By the time I closed my laptop it was already dark outside. Made some hummus from a jar and ate it with stale bread while scrolling through news I did not really read.

Fatima called but I let it ring. Texted her later that I was in a meeting. I was not. I just did not have anything to say.

**Nudge:** "What would you have said if you'd picked up?"

**Response:** Probably just the usual. Work is fine, eating okay, miss you. The same loop. Sometimes I do not want to perform that script.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-14

The new hire, Emma, asked me to pair program today. She needed help understanding the ownership model in Rust. I spent two hours explaining borrow checker errors, drawing diagrams on my tablet, watching her face shift from confusion to clarity.

By the end, she said, "Tariq, you should do a lunch-and-learn for the whole team." I laughed and said maybe. But I meant it. That felt like the best two hours I have had in weeks.

**Nudge:** "Are you going to do it?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-15

Flying home tomorrow. Already packed my bag, already checked in online. I keep refreshing the weather app for Amman like it is going to change.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-22

Back in Berlin. The flat smells stale. I opened all the windows even though it was cold. Fatima and I spent four days together and I still feel like I missed something.

**Nudge:** "What did you miss?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-22

Same day, later. Could not sleep. My brother called to ask when I am coming back for good. I said I do not know. He said our mother keeps asking about me. I told him I would call her soon. I probably will not.

**Nudge:** "What stops you from calling her?"

**Response:** Because she will ask questions I do not have answers to. When are you retiring? Why are you not here? I left at 56 and I cannot explain that to her in a way that does not sound like running away.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-26

Did the lunch-and-learn. Fifteen people showed up, including the CTO. I walked them through memory safety concepts, showed some examples of common pitfalls, answered questions for twenty minutes after.

Afterwards, Marco from the backend team said, "You should have been teaching this whole time." I do not know if that was a compliment or a comment on my code contributions. Either way, I felt useful in a way I have not felt in months.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-01

Got feedback in my one-on-one that I should "lean into documentation more." I think that means they want me to write rather than code. I nodded and said I would think about it.

**Nudge:** "How did that land?"

**Response:** Like being put on the shelf. Maybe I am reading too much into it, but it felt like being redirected.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-03

Saturday. Went to Mauerpark, watched people sing karaoke in the amphitheater. A guy my age was doing a terrible version of a song I did not recognize. His friends were cheering like he was winning something.

**Nudge:** "What were you thinking while you watched him?"

**Response:** That he did not care if he was bad. He just wanted to be up there. I have not felt that kind of careless in a long time.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-03

Same day, evening. Walked back along the canal, bought a kebab from a place near Eberswalder, ate it sitting on a bench. The light was that soft gold that Berlin gets sometimes before sunset.

I have been here six months. Half a year of takeaway containers and video calls and learning syntax. Half a year of proving I could start over. I do not know what comes next. The lease on my flat is up in August. The project I joined will probably ship by then, or it will not. Either way I will have to decide something.

The kebab was good. The guy remembered my order from last time. That felt like more continuity than anything else in my life right now.

**Nudge:** "What are your options?"

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-06

My manager asked if I had considered moving into a developer advocate role. Travel, conferences, representing the company to external developers. "You have the experience and the presence," she said.

I told her I would think about it. What I did not tell her is that it sounds like being put in front of people because they do not know where else to put me. I came here to build things. Not to talk about building things.

But maybe I am being stubborn. Fatima would say I am being stubborn. She would say any role is a role if you do it well. Maybe she is right. I do not know.

**Nudge:** "What would you lose if you took it?"

## Entry 11 - 2025-05-12

Had dinner with Lukas and Emma last night. They took me to some trendy place in Kreuzberg with exposed brick and cocktails that cost too much. We talked about the project, about their weekend plans, about nothing in particular.

At some point Emma asked how I ended up in Berlin. I told them the short version: got bored, saw a job posting, applied on a whim, got the offer, said yes. Lukas looked at me like I had told him I climbed Everest. "At 56?" he said. "My dad is 55 and he complains about learning new apps."

I did not know how to explain it to him. That staying in Amman felt like watching the same episode of a show I had already seen. That I needed to not know what was going to happen next. That the discomfort of being the oldest person in the room is better than the comfort of being exactly where everyone expected me to be.

I just shrugged and said, "Different people want different things."

**Nudge:** "What did you want to say instead?"

**Response:** That I was terrified when I got on that plane. That I still am, most days. But the fear feels more alive than the certainty I left behind.
