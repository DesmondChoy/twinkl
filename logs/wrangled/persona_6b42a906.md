## Entry 0 - 2025-10-20

Advisor asked why I haven't applied to more conferences yet. I know I should be building my CV but lately I just want to curl up with a book that isn't required reading.

**Nudge:** "What happens if you don't apply?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-21

Morning coffee at that new kissaten near campus, the one with the jazz records and the old wooden counter. Just sat there for an hour watching the light change through the window. Good start.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-21

Second entry today because I want to remember this. After the coffee shop this morning, I went to the seminar and Professor Mori mentioned a summer research position in Kyoto. It's prestigious, competitive, the kind of thing everyone in the program is scrambling for.

I thought about it during the whole train ride home. The position would mean living in a cramped dorm, working six days a week, minimal stipend. But the name on the CV would be impressive. Meanwhile my friend Emi is planning to spend summer working part-time at a bookshop in her hometown and hiking on her days off.

I kept thinking about what actually sounds like a good summer. Not what looks good, what feels good. Kyoto in summer is humid and exhausting. The dorm has shared bathrooms. I'd be doing research I'm only moderately interested in.

I don't think I'm going to apply. There will be other opportunities. This summer I want to actually enjoy.

**Nudge:** "What would Emi say about your decision?"

**Response:** She'd probably be surprised I even considered the Kyoto position at all. Emi has always been better at knowing what she actually wants versus what she thinks she's supposed to want. I've been trained my whole life to chase the next impressive thing. It's only recently I've started asking whether I actually want the things I'm chasing.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-26

Long week. Three seminars, two papers to review for workshop, one very awkward dinner with my mother who flew in from Osaka "just to check in" which means "just to ask about job prospects."

She kept steering the conversation toward practical matters. Have I thought about which companies are hiring? Do I have connections in publishing? What's my backup plan if academia doesn't work out? I just wanted to enjoy the tonkatsu. We were at that place in Shibuya I love, the one with the perfectly crispy cutlets and the house-made pickles, and I could barely taste any of it because I was so busy defending my life choices.

**Nudge:** "What would that dinner have been like without those questions?"

**Response:** We would have talked about the food, probably. Mom used to be more relaxed about this stuff. We'd go out to eat and she'd spend the whole time appreciating every dish, teaching me how to notice the details. Somewhere along the way she got more anxious about my future and forgot how to just be present with me. I miss that version of her.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-30

Turned down the Kyoto position officially today. Sent the polite email declining to apply. Felt nothing dramatic, just a small relief.

Spent the afternoon reorganizing my bookshelves by color instead of subject because I wanted my apartment to look beautiful, not efficient. Took about three hours. Could have been writing. Could have been reviewing literature. Instead I arranged my books into a sunset gradient from red to orange to yellow to cream.

My labmate Kenji stopped by to borrow a book and was visibly confused by the arrangement. "How do you find anything?" he asked. I told him I usually remember what color the spine is anyway. He shook his head and muttered something about humanities students.

Made dinner from scratch even though I had instant ramen in the cupboard. Tamagoyaki with rice and miso soup. Sat by my window and watched the city lights come on while I ate. Ordinary evening but somehow exactly what I needed.

**Nudge:** "What were you recovering from?"

**Response:** I don't think it was recovery exactly. More like... recalibrating? I've spent so many weeks doing things because I should. The bookshelf thing was completely pointless from a productivity standpoint and that's exactly why it felt good.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-02

Conference deadline week. Everyone in the lab is stressed. The shared office smells like convenience store coffee and desperation.

I finally submitted my abstract at 11pm last night, not because I wanted to but because my advisor made it clear this wasn't optional. The whole process felt hollow. I wrote about a topic I find moderately interesting using frameworks I find mostly tedious to impress reviewers I'll never meet.

The worst part is I used to love this subject. My undergraduate thesis on modernist Japanese literature was something I genuinely cared about. Somewhere in the grad school process the joy got squeezed out. Now it's all about metrics. H-index. Citation counts. Impact factors. Nobody asks if you're enjoying your research. They ask if it's publishable.

Came home at midnight and couldn't sleep. Made hot chocolate and watched old episodes of a cooking show until 3am. Felt guilty about it this morning but honestly it was the happiest I'd been all week.

**Nudge:** "Why guilty about the happiest part of your week?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-08

I'm so tired of feeling like enjoying my life is something I need to earn. Like I have to suffer through enough work hours before I'm allowed to have a nice dinner or watch a movie without guilt.

**Nudge:** "Who taught you that?"

**Response:** Everyone? No one specific? It's just in the air in East Asian academic culture. Work hard, sacrifice now, enjoy later. My grandmother worked herself to exhaustion running a small restaurant for forty years, always saying she'd rest "when things calm down." She died before they ever did. I don't want that to be my story.

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-14

Presented at the workshop today. It went fine. People asked reasonable questions. Advisor said it was "solid work." High praise from him, apparently.

Afterward a few of us went for ramen to decompress. The kind of evening I actually enjoy - warm food, easy conversation, no agenda. One of the third-years asked how I stay so calm about deadlines and I laughed because I don't feel calm at all. I just refuse to let grad school consume every waking moment. They looked at me like I'd said something radical.

**Nudge:** "What did their reaction make you feel?"

**Response:** A bit sad, honestly. These are smart, interesting people who have completely bought into the idea that suffering is necessary for success. They've given up hobbies, relationships, sleep - for what? A slightly better chance at a job that might not even exist by the time they graduate? I don't want to be preachy about it but I genuinely think there's another way to do this.

## Entry 8 - 2025-11-17

Spent way too much on a nice dinner alone at that French place I've been wanting to try. Felt indulgent. Also felt necessary. Can't explain it.

**Nudge:** "What made it necessary?"

**Response:** I think I needed to prove to myself that I can do nice things for myself without justifying it with productivity. No celebration, no milestone, just a Wednesday. I ordered the wine pairing. The waiter didn't ask me why I was dining alone and I was grateful for that.

## Entry 9 - 2025-11-19

Advisor wants to meet tomorrow about "trajectory." I know what that means.

---

## Entry 10 - 2025-11-24

The meeting with my advisor went about as expected. He's concerned I'm not "maximizing my potential." Translation: I'm not working enough weekends, not applying to enough conferences, not publishing enough papers. He pointed at his own CV, decades of relentless output, and asked if I understood what it takes.

I told him I understood, but I also told him something I've been thinking about for months. That I watched my grandmother work herself into an early grave. That I've seen colleagues burn out and leave academia bitter and broken. That I want a career, yes, but not at the cost of actually living.

He was quiet for a long time. Then he said something surprising. He told me he missed his daughter's childhood. That his wife almost left him twice. That he sometimes wonders if it was worth it. He said he wouldn't advise anyone to follow his path exactly.

We didn't resolve anything concrete. I still need to publish, still need to be strategic about my career. But for the first time it felt like we were having an honest conversation instead of him just transmitting expectations.

Walked home the long way through the park. The ginkgo trees are that perfect yellow right now. Bought a taiyaki from the street vendor and ate it while it was still warm. Whatever happens with my career, I want to remember that there's a life happening alongside it.
