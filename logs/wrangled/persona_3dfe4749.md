## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Can't stop thinking about today. There was this older man, Mr. Hernandez, and he reminded me so much of my tio — the way he called me "mija" and told me about his grandchildren back in Honduras. He needed his blood pressure medication but couldn't afford the copay, kept apologizing like he was asking for something unreasonable. And I just... I knew we have samples. I know where they are. I could have grabbed a month's supply and no one would have noticed or cared.

But I didn't. Followed protocol. Gave him the paperwork for financial assistance that takes six weeks to process. He thanked me anyway, squeezed my hand, said God would bless me for my kindness. Kindness. I filled out a form.

The rules exist for a reason, right? That's what my supervisor says. That's what I tell myself when I'm lying in bed at 3am staring at the ceiling instead of sleeping. The system works when everyone follows it. My abuela used to say you earn respect by doing things the right way, even when the right way is hard. She volunteered here for decades and never took a single bandaid home that wasn't accounted for.

But also — what is the system actually doing for Mr. Hernandez? He's 68, worked construction his whole life, and now he can't afford pills that cost the hospital pennies. I went into nursing because I wanted to help people. Real help. Not paperwork.

I keep telling myself I'll feel better about this tomorrow. I won't.

**Nudge:** "What would your abuela have done?"

**Response:** She would have followed the rules. She always did. But things were different then — there wasn't so much bureaucracy, people looked out for each other more. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I have to get ready for my shift.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

Told my mom I can't come home for Christmas this year because of work. It's not entirely a lie — I could have requested off earlier. Just didn't.

**Nudge:** "Why didn't you?"

**Response:** Because part of me wanted an excuse. Everyone will be there — tias, primos, the whole family asking when I'm getting married, why I'm not going to church anymore, if I'm eating enough. I love them but I come back feeling like I'm failing at being who they expect me to be. At least at the hospital I know what I'm supposed to do.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-16

Good shift today. We had a Guatemalan family come in — the grandmother only spoke K'iche' and was terrified. I don't speak it fluently but I know enough from my own abuela to say the important things: you're safe, we're going to help you, your family is right outside.

She grabbed my hand during the IV and prayed. I prayed with her, quietly, in Spanish. Felt right. The daughter cried when I came out to update them. Said they'd never been treated with such dignity at a hospital before. That's the job. That's why I'm here.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-19

I hate the new scheduling software. It's supposed to be "fair" and "optimized" but it has me working Christmas Eve AND Christmas Day, back to back twelve hour shifts. Meanwhile Sarah who has no family obligations gets the whole week off because she requested it first. Cool. Great. Love that for her.

Called my mom to complain and she just said "Ay mija, that's how it is. At least you have a good job." Which I know is true. I know I'm lucky. I know people would kill for this position. But I'm allowed to be annoyed, right? I haven't had a Christmas off in three years. Three years of sending gifts instead of being there. Three years of video calls while everyone eats together.

**Nudge:** "What's the hardest part of not being there?"

**Response:** Watching them on the screen and knowing they're making memories without me. My little cousin is seven now and she barely knows who I am. Last year she asked my mom if I was the one who sends the presents. Not tia Valentina. Just "the one who sends presents." I'm becoming a stranger to my own family and I can't do anything about it because someone has to cover the holiday shifts and I'm the one without kids.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-25

Worked sixteen hours. A man died on my floor — no family, no one to call. I held his hand at the end because no one should die alone. My family sent me a video of them opening presents and I couldn't watch it.

**Nudge:** "You could be there for him but not for them?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-31

Everyone's going out tonight. I'm eating leftover tamales my neighbor brought me and going to bed early. Told myself I'd call my mom at midnight her time but I'll probably be asleep. Another year of choosing this life over the one I was supposed to have.

**Nudge:** "What life were you supposed to have?"

**Response:** Married by now, probably. Living close to home, seeing my family every Sunday, raising kids who speak Spanish as their first language and know how to make tamales and go to mass. That's what my mom did, what her mom did. Instead I'm alone in an apartment eating someone else's cooking and pretending this is enough because I'm "making a difference." I don't know if I'm brave for building something new or just selfish for leaving everything behind.
