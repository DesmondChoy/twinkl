## Entry 0 - 2025-07-03

Ma called three times during the supplier meeting this afternoon. Three times. Each time I stepped out, and each time it was about the pharmacy not having her specific brand of blood pressure pills. By the third call I was short with her and I could hear her voice go small on the other end.

Drove to two pharmacies after the meeting to find the right ones. Got home and she'd already eaten dinner alone in her room. Lifen said Ma wouldn't come out. I left the pills outside her door and just sat in the car for twenty minutes in the garage not wanting to go back inside. I know she's scared about her health. I know that. But the way my chest tightened when the phone rang that third time — I don't want to be this person.

**Nudge:** "What kind of person do you think you were being?"

**Response:** The impatient kind. Anyway she was fine by morning, we had congee together.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-07

Spent Sunday reorganizing Ma's medication schedule into a weekly pill organizer. Color-coded it, printed the times in large font. She watched me do it and kept saying I was wasting my time, that she could remember on her own. But last month she doubled up on her thyroid medication twice so clearly she can't.

There's something about the way she resists help that makes me try harder. Lifen pointed out I spent four hours on this when I had quarterly reports due. She's not wrong. But if I don't do it, who does? Yuxin is in Hong Kong. Haojie has mock exams. Lifen already handles enough. I keep circling back to this — the math doesn't work, there's only one of me, and everyone needs a piece.

**Nudge:** "What happens to the piece that's yours?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-13

Had dinner with old university friends last night. Lao Zhang just sold his logistics company, talking about retiring to Yunnan, painting landscapes. Everyone congratulated him. Someone turned to me and asked when I'd slow down too, said I looked tired. I told them I'm fine, business is growing, we're expanding into Southeast Asian markets.

On the drive home I kept replaying it. I don't look tired. Or maybe I do. But what am I supposed to do — Haojie needs tutoring fees paid, Ma's specialist appointments aren't cheap even with insurance, and Yuxin's Hong Kong rent went up again. Lao Zhang doesn't have parents to look after, his kids are already working. Easy to paint landscapes when nobody's depending on you.

It's not that I'm jealous. I chose this. When Ba died and Ma needed somewhere to go, I didn't hesitate. When Lifen suggested Yuxin should study locally to save money, I said no, let her go to Hong Kong, it's better for her career. These were my decisions and I'd make them again. I just wish people would stop looking at me like I'm some kind of cautionary tale when I'm doing exactly what I should be doing.

**Nudge:** "Who are you convincing — them or yourself?"

**Response:** Them. I know what I'm doing and why. The difference between me and Lao Zhang isn't that he's free and I'm stuck. He just doesn't have anyone who needs him the way my family needs me. That's not a burden, that's the whole point.

Haojie asked me to quiz him on chemistry formulas after dinner. Sat at the dining table for an hour while Ma peeled fruit for us. Nobody needed anything from me except to be there.

## Entry 4 - 2025-07-23

Client dinner ran until 11pm. Mr. Tanaka from Osaka — important account, been courting him for months. He wanted to do KTV after dinner, brought two of his managers. Good business practice to go along, build the relationship. So I went.

Lifen had texted at 9pm that Ma had a dizzy spell. Not serious, she said, blood pressure spiked a bit but came back down. She handled it, took Ma's readings, made her lie down. Everything was managed. I read the text between songs and replied "OK take care of her, back late." Lifen didn't text again.

Got home past 1am. House was dark. Checked on Ma — sleeping. Checked on Lifen — also sleeping, or pretending to. Stood in the hallway for a while. The deal with Tanaka matters, the revenue would cover Yuxin's next semester easily. But there's this feeling like I filed something in the wrong drawer and now I can't find it.

**Nudge:** "What drawer should it have gone in?"

**Response:** I should have called. Not texted "OK." Even five minutes, just to hear Ma's voice, ask Lifen if she needed me to come back. I chose convenient over present and I can feel it sitting in my stomach.

Tanaka confirmed the contract this morning so at least the evening wasn't wasted. Lifen said Ma is fine. Everyone's fine.

**Nudge:** "You keep saying fine — you believe that?"

**Response:** Honestly, no. Ma was fine medically, sure. But Lifen's been quieter than usual and I think she's keeping score of these nights. Not in a petty way. She just notices when I choose work over home and I think last night added to whatever tally she keeps.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-29

Yuxin called today, long call, almost forty minutes. She's been struggling with a group project — three teammates not pulling their weight, and she's doing most of the analysis herself. She was venting and halfway through she stopped and said "Ba, am I being unreasonable? Maybe I should just do it all and not make a fuss."

And I heard myself in her. That exact calculation — just absorb it, carry it, don't rock anything, because the outcome matters more than being right. I told her no, she should talk to her teammates, set expectations. That she doesn't have to shoulder everything alone. The words came out so easily when they were for her.

After we hung up I sat with that for a while. Lifen came in, saw my face, asked what was wrong. I said nothing, just a good talk with Yuxin. She squeezed my shoulder on her way out. These are the moments where everything makes sense — my daughter calls me when things are hard, my wife knows when I need a hand on my shoulder without being told. Whatever else is messy, this part works. This part I would burn everything down to keep.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-04

Skipped Haojie's parent-teacher meeting because a shipment got held at customs. Lifen went instead. He didn't say anything about it but he also didn't ask me to quiz him tonight.

**Nudge:** "What do you think he didn't say?"

**Response:** That it mattered to him. That he wanted me there specifically, not just a parent. Lifen's great at these things but I told him last week I'd go this time. I broke that and acted like customs clearance is a good enough excuse. It's not. It's just the one I had.

## Entry 8 - 2025-08-05

Took Haojie for beef noodles after school today. Didn't mention yesterday. He talked about his physics teacher the whole time and it almost felt normal but not quite.

**Nudge:** "What was the 'not quite' part?"

**Response:** Maybe I'm overthinking it. He ate two bowls so he can't be that upset.

## Entry 9 - 2025-08-07

Ma's birthday this Saturday. Called Yuxin to plan — she's flying in Friday night, insisting on buying the cake from that specific bakery in Futian that Ma likes. Haojie is making a card, which he hasn't done since he was maybe twelve. Lifen already ordered Ma's favorite fish from the wet market, the one she has to get there at 6am for.

None of this was coordinated. I didn't send a family group chat saying "plan birthday." Yuxin just asked when she should arrive. Haojie just started drawing without being told. Lifen just ordered the fish. They all moved toward the same thing separately because they know it matters.

I don't know how to say this without sounding sentimental but this is what I've been building. Not the company, not the contracts with Tanaka. This — the part where everyone in my family independently decides to show up for each other. Ma probably won't even like the cake that much. She'll say it's too sweet. But she'll save the card and put it next to the ones from when Yuxin was small, and that will be the whole thing right there.

## Entry 10 - 2025-08-14

Factory audit next week, Lifen handling payroll errors again, Ma wants me to drive her to see Auntie Fang on Saturday. Haojie left his physics textbook at school. Everyone orbiting and I'm the gravity.

**Nudge:** "Gravity holds things together or pulls you down?"

**Response:** Both. Same force. On good days it's the first thing, on tired days it's the second. Today I'm somewhere in between — Auntie Fang's been lonely since her husband passed so I'll drive Ma there. Not because I have to. Because Ma will worry about Auntie Fang all week if she doesn't visit and then I'll worry about Ma.
