Long day. Lost the Hendricks account because their new facilities guy wants to go with a national chain. Grandpa built that relationship in '89 and I just watched it walk out the door.

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-07

Dad brought up the Hendricks thing at Sunday dinner. In front of everyone. Said maybe I should have driven out there in person instead of sending a proposal over email. Like I haven't been running seventy hours a week already.

**Nudge:** "What stung most about your dad's comment?"

**Response:** That he might be right. Grandpa would've driven out there.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-12

Closed the Meyer Medical Group contract today — biggest commercial deal we've landed this quarter. Stayed late to call Grandpa and tell him before the rest of the family heard. He said "that's my boy" and I don't think I've smiled like that in a month.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-18

Had a call with the regional HVAC association about their young leaders program. They want me to apply for the board. On paper it's a great opportunity — good network, visibility in the industry, looks sharp on a resume. But the meetings are every other Thursday evening, which is when I do my site walkthroughs with the install crews.

Those walkthroughs aren't required. Nobody would notice if I stopped. But Grandpa drilled it into me when I started: you show up where the work happens, you shake the hands of the guys turning the wrenches. It's how you earn trust. Feels wrong to swap that out for a conference call with people trading business cards. But then I look at some of the other managers my age who are on three boards and speaking at conferences while I'm in a crawlspace checking ductwork.

**Nudge:** "Which one would keep you up at night?"

**Response:** The walkthroughs. No question. I'd never forgive myself otherwise.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-19

Thinking more about the board thing from yesterday. Turned it down this morning. Polite email, said maybe next year. But now I'm sitting with this feeling like I just closed a door I shouldn't have. My buddy Jake from college is VP of Operations at a company half our size. He's thirty-two. He's on two industry boards, he did that leadership program at Northwestern, and every time I see his LinkedIn I feel this pull in my chest like I'm falling behind some invisible race.

I know comparison is poison. I know that. But it's hard when the scoreboard is right there on your phone. Jake doesn't have a grandfather who spent fifty years building something with his name on it. Jake doesn't sit at a dinner table every Sunday hearing about how things were done the right way. Jake just has a title and a trajectory and nobody asking him to preserve anything.

Meanwhile I'm trying to grow this company AND keep it feeling like the company it's always been. Like those two things are the same direction. Most days they are. But days like today they feel like opposite ends of a rope and I'm standing in the middle.

**Nudge:** "Which parts of 'the right way' do you actually believe?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-19

Just realized I wrote twice in one day. Whatever. Came home and Jake posted about keynoting some supply chain conference. Good for him. I'm going to go prep my Q2 numbers because at least those are mine.

**Nudge:** "What do your Q2 numbers prove that Jake's keynote doesn't?"

**Response:** That I actually built something real. Forty-three paychecks.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-24

Grandpa's 80th birthday party Saturday. The whole family came — uncles, cousins, people I haven't seen since I was a kid. Mom put together a slideshow with photos from when he first started the company. There's one of him standing in front of his first van, WHITFIELD HEATING hand-painted on the side. He was twenty-six in that picture. Three years younger than I am now.

Uncle Bill gave a toast about how the company was built on handshakes and showing up. Everyone raised their glasses. I watched Grandpa's face and he was trying not to cry. He looked at me across the table at one point and nodded, this small nod like he was passing something forward. I can't explain why that hit so hard.

Later that night I went out to the driveway to get some air and my cousin Travis followed me out. He works in tech in Seattle, does well for himself. He asked me if I ever thought about doing something else, something that was just mine. I told him the company IS mine. He kind of shrugged and said "you know what I mean." I do know what he means. But I also think he doesn't understand what it feels like to be part of something that started before you were born and will keep going after you're gone. There's weight to that. Some days it's an anchor. Other days it's the only thing keeping me steady.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-25

Performance reviews this week. Had to sit down with each of my crew leads and go through their numbers. Most of the conversations went fine but Danny — he's been with us nineteen years, started under Grandpa — pushed back when I talked about the new scheduling software. Said it was "a solution looking for a problem" and that the whiteboard system works fine.

I wanted to snap at him. The whiteboard system loses us hours every week in double-bookings and missed follow-ups. I have the data. But instead I heard myself saying "let's give it a trial run and see how it goes, no pressure." Which is exactly what Grandpa would have done — never force it, bring people along. But part of me thinks Grandpa could afford to be patient because he had decades. I don't feel like I have decades. The market is moving and if we don't modernize the ops side we'll be the company that did great work in the '90s and couldn't keep up.

**Nudge:** "What would it cost you to overrule Danny and just implement it?"

**Response:** His respect. And every guy on the floor who remembers Grandpa.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-27

Danny used the new scheduling software today. Without being asked. Came in, saw the tablet on the wall, and just started putting jobs in. Didn't say a word about it. I didn't either.

**Nudge:** "You didn't say a word — what were you holding back?"

**Response:** Relief. Like I finally got permission to move forward.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-29

Sunday dinner. Grandpa wasn't feeling well so it was just Mom, Dad, and me. Without Grandpa at the table the whole energy was different. Dad talked about maybe expanding into the residential solar market. I've been thinking about it too — the margins are there, the demand is growing, it's a natural fit. But when I brought it up to Grandpa last month he said "we're heating and cooling people, that's what we do."

I didn't push it. How do you push it with an eighty-year-old man who built the thing from nothing? He earned the right to say no. But tonight Dad said something that's been rattling around in my head since — he said "your grandfather doesn't run the company anymore, Ryan. You do." And I know that's technically true. My name is on the decisions. But it doesn't feel true. It feels like I'm managing a museum and every choice I make is either a restoration or a renovation and I can never tell which one the family wants.

I keep going back to that nod at his birthday party. What was he passing to me exactly? The company as it is? Or the company as whatever I can make it? I genuinely don't know. And I'm scared to ask because what if the answer is something I can't live with.

**Nudge:** "What would change if he said 'make it yours'?"

## Entry 10 - 2025-07-05

Fourth of July at the lake house. The whole family thing — burgers, fireworks, Uncle Bill doing his annual speech about "what this country was built on." I usually tune it out but this year he looked at me during the part about "carrying the torch" and I realized he wasn't just talking about America.

Cousin Travis was there again. This time he asked how the company was doing and I gave him the numbers — up fourteen percent year over year, best Q2 since 2019, retention above ninety percent. He nodded and said "so it's doing well?" and I said yes. Then he asked "but are YOU doing well?" and I didn't have an answer. I said something about being busy, which is true but not what he was asking. The honest answer is I don't separate the two. The company does well, I'm doing well. The company struggles, I struggle. I don't know if that's dedication or if it's a problem.

**Nudge:** "If the company disappeared tomorrow, what would be left of you?"

**Response:** I honestly don't know. That's what scares me.

## Entry 11 - 2025-07-12

Had a weird moment today. Was driving back from a site visit and passed the old Whitfield Heating building — the original one on Division Avenue that Grandpa worked out of before we moved to the new place in '02. It's a laundromat now. The sign is gone, the awning's different, there's nothing left of what it was. Just a building someone else uses for something else. I pulled over and sat there for a minute. Not because I was sad exactly. More like I was looking at the future.

Someday the new building will be something else too. Someday the name on the trucks will change, or the trucks will be gone, or the whole industry will be different. Nothing I do is permanent. Nothing Grandpa did was permanent. The only thing that lasts is whether you did it right while you were doing it.

Something shifted sitting in that parking lot. Like maybe I've been so focused on holding everything together exactly as it is that I forgot the point was never the building or the sign. It was how you treated people, how you showed up, whether you left things better than you found them. Grandpa didn't preserve his father's business — he built his own. Maybe that's what the nod meant. Not "keep this the same." Just "do it right." I'm still not sure about solar. But I'm less afraid of the question now.

**Nudge:** "What changed between last month and this parking lot moment?"

**Response:** I stopped seeing it as either/or. It was never about furnaces.
