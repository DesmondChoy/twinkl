# Persona b963f9bc: Mei-Lin Chen

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** b963f9bc
- **Name:** Mei-Lin Chen
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Teacher
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Conformity
- **Bio:** Mei-Lin teaches high school mathematics at a prestigious academy in Taipei, where she's known for her meticulous lesson plans and her willingness to stay late helping struggling students. She lives three blocks from her parents, visiting every Sunday for dinner where her mother invariably comments on her unmarried status at 38. She turned down a department head position last year because it would have meant implementing a new curriculum her senior colleagues opposed. On rare evenings alone, she practices calligraphy — the one pursuit where following precise strokes feels like freedom rather than obligation.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Parent-teacher conferences ran until 7pm tonight. Twenty-three families, twenty-three variations of the same careful dance — praising where possible, suggesting improvements without offending, never saying anything that might prompt a complaint to Principal Wu. Mrs. Huang brought her mother-in-law, which meant I had two generations asking why her son wasn't top of the class. I said all the right things about Wei's potential and his need for more practice. I didn't mention that he spends most of class drawing in his notebook.

Walking home, I felt that familiar tiredness that comes from holding my face in the right expression all day. But also something like satisfaction. Nobody left upset. No difficult calls tomorrow. My colleague Teacher Lin had three parents demand meetings with administration after his conferences last month — he told one mother her daughter was "mediocre at best." He's not wrong, technically. But there are ways to say things, and there are other ways. I'd rather be tired than cause that kind of mess.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

My hands are still shaking a little. I had to report a student today — Jia-Hui, one of my brightest — for cheating on the midterm exam. She copied answers from the student beside her. I saw it clearly, and worse, she saw me see it.

The look on her face. Like I'd betrayed her somehow, when she was the one breaking the rules. I followed protocol exactly: documented the incident, submitted the report to the academic integrity office, informed her homeroom teacher. Everything by the book. But she's been crying in the bathroom all afternoon, and three of her friends gave me cold looks in the hallway.

The thing that keeps running through my head is what Principal Wu said when he reviewed my report: "Good catch, Teacher Chen. We appreciate your vigilance." Vigilance. Like I'm some kind of guard. I don't want to be the person students are afraid of. I want them to trust me. But if I'd looked away, if I'd pretended not to notice — wouldn't that be worse? Wouldn't that be telling Jia-Hui that rules don't matter, that integrity is flexible?

My mother would say I did right. "A teacher who ignores cheating isn't a teacher," she'd say. She taught chemistry for thirty years and never once let a student slide. I'm trying to believe that following the proper procedure was the correct choice. I just wish it didn't feel so much like I've lost something.

**Nudge:** "What exactly do you feel you might have lost?"

**Response:** Her trust, I suppose. Or maybe the version of myself that I prefer — the approachable teacher, the one students come to with their problems. Now I'm the one who reported Jia-Hui to administration. There's no taking that back. She'll always remember me as the teacher who got her in trouble, not the one who stayed after school to help her understand quadratic equations. I know I did what was expected of me. I just wonder sometimes if being the person everyone expects me to be means giving up other things I want to be.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-10

Long day. Department meeting after classes, then dinner at my parents' place, then home to grade thirty-eight exams. My mother asked again about "that nice man from church" and I said I'd think about it, same as last time, same as I will next time.

**Nudge:** "What is it about that topic that makes you say 'same as last time'?"

**Response:** It's not a big thing, really. My mother has been suggesting potential matches since I was thirty. It's just what mothers do. She means well. I told her I'm focused on work right now, which is true. The exam period is always exhausting and I don't have the energy to think about anything else.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-13

Saturday afternoon and I'm sitting in my apartment with a cup of cold tea I forgot to drink, thinking about the faculty dinner next Friday. Vice Principal Chang wants me to give a toast because I'm the "voice of the department" according to her, which means I'm the one who doesn't argue in meetings and makes everyone feel comfortable.

I've already written three drafts. The first was too long. The second used a metaphor about bamboo that sounded pretentious when I read it aloud. The third is fine, probably, but Teacher Lin will definitely make some comment afterward about how I'm "always so proper" and I can already feel myself smiling politely at him and saying something like "just doing my part."

There's a ceramics class starting at the community center next month. I saw the flyer at the grocery store. Every Saturday afternoon, two hours of making things with your hands. I keep thinking about it. I haven't signed up because it conflicts with my parents' usual visiting time. They would understand if I explained. They would say "of course, go to your class." But my mother's face would do that thing it does when she's disappointed but trying not to show it. And my father would eat dinner in silence the way he does when something's bothering him.

Is it ridiculous that I can't take a ceramics class because of a look on my mother's face? It sounds ridiculous when I write it out. Plenty of people would just go, would say "I'm an adult, I can spend my Saturdays how I want." But that's not... I don't know. That's not how my family works. We show up for each other. That's the deal.

I'll probably end up watching YouTube videos about ceramics instead. It's not the same, but it's something.

**Nudge:** "What draws you to making things with your hands?"

**Response:** I think it's because nothing I do in a day has any shape to it. Teaching is important, but at the end of a class, what do I have? Lesson plans for tomorrow. Grades to record. The students leave and the room is empty. Even calligraphy — I've been doing it for years and the scrolls just go in a drawer.

With ceramics, you'd have something. A bowl. A cup. Something you made that exists outside of obligation. Something nobody asked you to make, that nobody needs you to make, that doesn't have any purpose except that you wanted to make it. I don't have much of that in my life. Things that are just mine, just because I wanted them. Most things I do are because someone is expecting me to do them, and if I'm honest, I've started to forget what I want when no one's watching.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-18

The faculty dinner was fine. My toast went well — people laughed at the appropriate moments, Principal Wu nodded approvingly, nobody looked bored. Teacher Lin did make his comment afterward, and I did smile and say something polite. The whole evening was exactly what it was supposed to be.

On the way home I stopped at the community center and picked up the registration form for the ceramics class. I haven't filled it out yet. It's sitting on my kitchen table next to the stack of exams I still need to grade. My mother called this morning to confirm Sunday dinner and I didn't mention it. I'm not hiding it, exactly. I just haven't figured out how to bring it up in a way that won't make it into a whole conversation about why I need hobbies and whether this means I'm lonely and shouldn't I focus on meeting someone instead of playing with clay.

Maybe I won't sign up. It's a lot of money for something I've never tried. And Sunday dinners are important. Family is important. There's nothing wrong with my life the way it is. Lots of people would be grateful to have what I have — stable job, parents who care, a routine that works. I don't know why I keep picking at it.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned not knowing why you keep picking at it. What would it mean if you stopped?"
