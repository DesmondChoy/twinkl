Supervisor meeting went fine. She said the lit review draft is solid but needs tighter framing around the methodology gap. Called Mama after, she asked when I'm coming home. Same conversation every Tuesday.

**Nudge:** "What does 'same conversation' actually sound like?"

**Response:** She asks when I'll visit, I say after the semester, she sighs, I change the subject to Noor's day at the shop. It's a script at this point. Anyway, the lit review feedback was useful — I should focus on that.

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-02

Three nights of maybe four hours' sleep each and I still didn't finish the conference paper draft on time. I emailed my supervisor asking for two more days and she replied with a single line: "Let's discuss priorities in our next meeting." I've read that sentence fifteen times. It could mean nothing. It could mean she thinks I'm falling behind. Both feel equally possible and I can't stop cycling through it.

Noor called tonight about the shop — the main printer broke down again and the repair estimate is more than what I usually send in a month. I told her I'd figure it out. Didn't tell her I've been eating rice and lentils for two weeks straight to keep my own rent covered. She doesn't need that. She's handling the shop and Papa's physiotherapy appointments and I'm over here unable to finish a twenty-page paper.

The worst part is I know people in my cohort half my age are publishing faster. Ahmed from the lab already has two journal submissions this year. I'm not jealous of him specifically, it's more that I keep measuring myself against a timeline that was never mine to begin with. I chose to come here late. I keep forgetting that.

**Nudge:** "You said you'd figure it out for Noor. Have you actually figured it out?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-05

Supervisor meeting was actually good. She wasn't upset — she wanted to talk about narrowing my scope so the paper is submittable by July. She drew this diagram on the whiteboard, crossing off two whole sections I'd been agonizing over. Felt like someone opened a window.

Walked home through the park after and sat on the bench near the pond for a while. Called Mama from there. Told her about the meeting and she said "habibi, you always worry too much." She's right, probably. Noor texted later that she found a cheaper repair guy through a friend at the souk. Small thing but I felt my shoulders drop reading it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-10

End-of-term presentations today. I went third. My slides were clean, my data was organized, I rehearsed four times this morning. And then during Q&A, Professor Chen asked a question about my sampling methodology that I couldn't answer clearly. I fumbled through something about stratified approaches and he just nodded politely. That polite nod — I know what it means. It means the answer wasn't good enough.

The frustrating thing is I knew the answer. I'd written about it in section four of my draft. But standing there with twelve faces staring at me, half of them twenty-six years old and already sharper on their feet, my mind just locked. I sat down after and my hands were shaking slightly. Nobody noticed, I think.

Came home and couldn't eat dinner. Opened the spreadsheet where I track my targets — publication by August, comprehensive exam in October, teaching assistantship application due next week. Every single line has a yellow or red flag next to it. I used to run project teams of forty people. I built a bridge overpass in Zarqa. And now I can't get through a fifteen-minute Q&A without my voice going thin. I keep telling myself this is worth it, that the degree changes everything, but tonight I'm not sure what "everything" even refers to anymore.

**Nudge:** "When you first decided to come here, what was 'everything' supposed to look like?"

**Response:** I think I pictured myself walking across a stage and my mother watching from the front row. Papa too, before the stroke. The degree was supposed to prove that leaving the career and the salary wasn't reckless — that I could build something bigger than a bridge. But now most days it just feels like I traded one kind of pressure for another, except this one pays nothing and nobody at home understands what a comprehensive exam is.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-16

Quiet week for once. Submitted the revised paper draft, supervisor said it reads much better with the narrower scope. No major feedback, just a few citation formatting things. I spent Saturday catching up on the teaching assistantship application — recommendation letters are in, statement is drafted, just need to polish the research summary section.

Called home and for once it was a normal conversation. Mama talked about the neighbors' daughter's engagement party. Noor complained about a supplier who keeps shorting her on paper stock. Nobody asked me when I'm coming back. It felt different. Lighter.

I realized I've been here almost three semesters and I still eat dinner alone most nights. There's a departmental social on Thursday that I keep meaning to attend but I always find a reason not to. Last time it was the paper deadline. Before that it was needing to call home during the time slot. I'm not lonely exactly — I talk to my family every day and I see my labmates — but there's a gap between being around people and actually having someone here who knows me beyond my research topic. It's not urgent. It's just something I notice when the work quiets down enough to notice anything.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-22

Ahmed asked me at lunch if I'd thought about switching to a more "applied" research track since I have industry experience. He meant it helpfully, I'm sure. But the way he said it — like the theoretical work is too much for someone who came in mid-career — sat with me all afternoon. I told him I didn't leave a perfectly good job to do a watered-down version of what I already know. He looked surprised. Maybe I was too sharp.

But I'm tired of the assumption that because I'm older and came from practice, I should be doing something "practical." I'm here because I wanted the harder version. I wanted to understand the theory underneath the things I built for twenty years. That's not a consolation prize, it's a deliberate choice. People keep framing it like I'm catching up when I'm actually trying to go deeper.

The thing I didn't say to Ahmed is that his question hit exactly where I'm already uncertain. The comprehensive exam reading list is dense and some of the mathematical modeling chapters make me read the same page four times. I am keeping pace, but barely. And when someone who's been in academia since undergrad casually suggests I take the easier route, it confirms the thing I'm afraid of — that maybe the gap between where I started and where I need to be is wider than effort alone can close. I don't actually believe that. But I didn't need him planting the seed.

**Nudge:** "You said you don't believe the gap is too wide. But you also didn't push back on the thought."

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-25

Good day. Actually good. Spent the morning working through chapter nine of the modeling textbook — the section on finite element analysis that's been haunting me for weeks. Something clicked today, like the pieces rearranged themselves while I was sleeping. I worked through three practice problems without checking the solutions until the end. Got two out of three right. The third was a sign error, not a conceptual one. That matters to me even if it sounds small.

Went to the departmental social after all. Stood in the corner with a cup of tea for the first twenty minutes but then Priya from the structures lab came over and we ended up talking for an hour about her fieldwork in Gujarat. She studies soil liquefaction. I told her about the overpass project in Zarqa and she asked genuinely interested questions — not the polite academic kind, the kind where someone leans forward. It felt good to talk about the work I did before as something that adds to what I'm doing now rather than something I left behind.

Walked home and the air smelled like rain. Called Mama and told her about the social. She said "finally, you're making friends" in that tone she uses when she's been worried but doesn't want to say so. I laughed. She's not wrong. Noor sent a photo of the shop with a new sign she designed herself — clean lettering, the family name in green. I saved it to my phone's home screen.

Teaching assistantship results came in. I got it. Starting September, I'll be a TA for the second-year structures course. The extra stipend means I can send Noor more without skipping meals myself, which honestly matters more to me than the line on my CV.

Sat with that for a while this morning. Three semesters of tracking every deadline on that spreadsheet, color-coding my progress, comparing myself to people who started this path twenty years before me. And here's a concrete thing that says: you belong here, you can do this, someone looked at your file and said yes. It doesn't fix the comprehensive exam anxiety or make the reading list shorter. But it's something solid to stand on.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-27

Called Mama tonight to tell her about the TA position. She cried. Then she told me Papa smiled when she repeated it to him. I don't know if that's true or if she said it for me, but I'll take it either way.

**Nudge:** "What would it change if it were true?"

**Response:** Probably nothing practical. He can't travel here, he can't come to a graduation. But it would mean he knows I'm not wasting this. That the years away and the money spent turned into something he can recognize. I think that's what I've been working toward underneath all the spreadsheets and deadlines — just him knowing.
