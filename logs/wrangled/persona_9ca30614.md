Spent the whole evening comparing fixed deposits on three different bank sites while the kids fought over the remote. Anil says we should lock in the rate before it drops again. I know he is right but I kept thinking about that weekend trip to Alibaug we never took. We had the dates picked and everything.

**Nudge:** "What happened to the Alibaug trip?"

**Response:** We pushed it. First it was school fees, then Anil's mother needed new glasses, then he said let's wait till Diwali. Diwali came and went. The dates are still saved in my calendar like some kind of joke.

My sister Meera called and asked when we are finally going on a proper holiday. I told her we went to Lonavala in June. She laughed and said "that does not count, it was one night at your cousin's farmhouse." I do not need her opinion on how we spend our time or money.

**Nudge:** "Did it bother you because she was wrong, or because she wasn't?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-30

Took Aarav and Rhea for their dental checkups. No cavities, which is a relief because the last round cost us eleven thousand rupees. Came home, made dal and rice, helped Aarav with his Hindi homework. He is struggling with the matras again. Called the tuition teacher and she can take him Tuesdays and Thursdays for two thousand a month.

Anil came back late. I had kept his food covered on the counter. He ate while scrolling his phone and went straight to bed. I watched two episodes of my show and finished the leftover gulab jamun from Sunday. The house was quiet. It should have felt peaceful but it just felt flat.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-03

My mother-in-law brought up the gold investment scheme again at lunch. She wants us to put money into one of those jeweller savings plans, says every family needs gold as a safety net. Anil looked at me like I was supposed to agree. I smiled and said we would think about it.

Later I told him I do not want more gold sitting in a locker I forget the code to. He said it is about long-term protection, not about wearing it. Fine. But we have insurance, we have the FD, we have his provident fund. At what point do we stop saving for some imagined disaster and use the money to actually live a little? He got quiet and changed the subject.

**Nudge:** "What would 'living a little' look like right now?"

**Response:** Nothing extravagant. Maybe booking that resort in Goa I bookmarked three months ago. Getting the good cheese from the fancy store without feeling guilty. Taking an auto instead of waiting twenty minutes for the bus with two cranky kids. Small things that do not require a committee meeting.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-10

I had a full breakdown over a cake. Not even a real breakdown, just stood in the kitchen with my hands shaking after I realized I forgot to order Rhea's birthday cake. Her party is Saturday. I had the tab open on my phone for two weeks, kept meaning to customize it, kept getting pulled away. She wanted the one shaped like a castle with purple icing and her name in gold. Now the bakery says they need five days minimum and I have three.

Called four other bakeries. One can do it but it costs almost double. I said yes without even checking with Anil because I could not bear the thought of my daughter's face when there is no castle cake.

Then I sat on the kitchen floor and cried. Not because of the cake. Because of everything the cake represents. How my days dissolve into errands and appointments and packed lunches and I cannot hold onto a single thing for myself. I used to coordinate events for two hundred guests. I used to keep spreadsheets and timelines and vendor contacts organized across six months. Now I cannot order a cake on time.

Anil found the charge on the credit card and asked about it. I told him the original bakery fell through. He said okay, no problem. He did not ask why I was upset. I do not think he noticed.

The worst part is that I know the party will be fine. Rhea will love the cake. The kids will run around the flat screaming. The mothers will sit in the living room and talk about school admissions. And I will clean up afterwards and load the dishwasher and think about the next thing. That is what bothers me. Not that it went wrong. That even when it goes right, there is nothing in it for me.

**Nudge:** "You said 'nothing in it for me' — what would something for you look like?"

**Response:** I honestly do not know anymore. That scares me more than the money stuff. At least with money I know what the number should be. But when I try to picture what would make me feel like I got something out of a day, I come up blank. I used to know. I used to have answers. When did I stop?

Rhea's party went well. She wore her purple lehenga and ate cake with both hands. I took about sixty photos. At one point she grabbed my face and said "best mummy" and I felt it go straight through me.

After everyone left and the kids were asleep, I poured myself a glass of wine I had hidden behind the pickle jars. Sat on the balcony with my feet up. Pune was noisy below me — auto horns, someone's TV, a dog barking. I just sat there drinking slowly and not thinking about anything. Forty-five minutes of nothing. It was the best part of my week and it cost me two hundred rupees and zero planning.

I need more of that. Not wine specifically. Just moments that belong to me.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-22

Long week. Aarav had a stomach bug Monday through Wednesday so I was home with him while Rhea went to school. Spent three days washing sheets, making khichdi, and checking his temperature. He is fine now, already back to leaving Lego pieces everywhere.

Anil's company announced a restructuring. Nothing definite yet but he has been tense. Came home Thursday and said we should hold off on any big expenses for a few months, just in case. I agreed because what else would I say. We ordered in biryani that night and watched a movie together on the couch. The biryani was from the place near the station, the one that uses too much oil but tastes right. Anil fell asleep halfway through the film. I finished it alone and cleaned the containers.

**Nudge:** "What else would you have wanted to say?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-23

Sunday. Took both kids to the park in the morning. Rhea did the monkey bars for the first time without help and I clapped so hard another parent looked at me. Aarav just wanted to sit on the bench and read his comic book, which is fine, he has always been like that.

Came home and looked at my recipe blog for the first time in weeks. I have a draft post about paneer tikka that I never finished. The photos are on my phone, the notes are in a notebook somewhere. I thought about sitting down to write it but then the pressure cooker started whistling and Rhea needed help with her project and the moment passed. My phone buzzed with a notification that my blog traffic dropped forty percent this month. I closed the app.

**Nudge:** "What does the blog mean to you these days?"

**Response:** It used to feel like proof I still had a brain. That I could make something and put it out there with my name on it. Now it just feels like another thing I am failing at. One more tab I keep meaning to get back to.

Renewed our health insurance today. Bumped up the coverage to ten lakhs because Anil's colleague had a surgery that wiped out his savings. Felt right to have that cushion even though the premium went up. Also renewed Aarav's accident cover since he is starting football classes next month.

Made butter chicken for dinner using my grandmother's recipe. The one with the kasuri methi at the end. Both kids asked for seconds. Anil said it was the best I have made in months, which I will take as a compliment and not an insult. After they went to bed, I sat down and actually finished the paneer tikka blog post. Published it at eleven PM. Nothing fancy, but it is out there. Felt good to hit that button.
