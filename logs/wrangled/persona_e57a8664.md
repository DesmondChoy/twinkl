## Entry 0 - 2025-11-07

Spent most of the morning at the hospital with Mother again. Her blood pressure readings have been erratic and the doctors want to adjust her medication. I sat in that waiting room scrolling through my literature review notes, pretending I could focus on methodology while watching the clock. By the time we got home and I made sure she ate lunch and took her pills, half the day was gone.

I signed up for this PhD knowing it would be challenging. What I didn't account for was how often life would demand I put it aside. My advisor sent a gentle reminder about the chapter draft due next week. I haven't written a single new paragraph in twelve days.

Strange to be the oldest person in every seminar, still learning to say "I need more time" without feeling like a failure.

**Nudge:** "What does failure look like to you here?"

**Response:** I suppose it looks like proving everyone right — my former colleagues who raised eyebrows when I resigned, my brother who thinks this degree is a vanity project. They expected me to enjoy retirement properly: travel with my husband, babysit grandchildren, maybe volunteer at the temple. Instead I'm chasing citations at fifty-eight.

But if I'm honest, the deeper fear is wasting whatever sharp years I have left. There's a clock now that wasn't there at thirty. Every delay feels heavier.

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-13

My daughter called crying at eleven last night. Her husband is traveling for work again and the baby has been colicky for three days straight. She asked if I could come stay for the weekend to help. I said yes before she finished the sentence, and then hung up and stared at my calendar.

The weekend is when I was supposed to finally sit down and write. I had blocked off Saturday and Sunday entirely — no hospital visits, no groceries, no family dinners. Just me, my laptop, and the quiet of an empty apartment. I was looking forward to it the way you look forward to a small holiday.

Now I'm packing a bag instead. And I feel terrible for resenting it, even a little. She's my daughter. She's exhausted and alone and I'm her mother. What kind of person calculates their writing time when their child needs them?

But another part of me is tired of always being the one who drops everything. My husband won't go — he says he's "not good with babies," as if that's a permanent condition and not something you can simply choose to do. So it falls to me. It always falls to me.

I'm bringing my laptop. I'm telling myself I'll write at night after the baby sleeps. We both know that's not going to happen.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you said no, just this once?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-20

Back from my daughter's. Wrote nothing. Slept maybe four hours each night. The baby finally settled on Sunday evening, just in time for me to catch the train home.

I keep thinking about the pork belly buns from that little shop near her apartment. We walked there Saturday afternoon while the baby napped in the carrier. Twenty minutes of sunshine and soft dough and my daughter laughing at something I said. Those moments felt like breathing.

Maybe that has to be enough for now.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-26

Submitted the draft. Not my best work but it exists. My advisor responded within an hour with comments — mostly structural, nothing devastating.

Made congee for Mother tonight. She said it tasted like my grandmother's, which is the highest compliment she gives. Small victories.

**Nudge:** "How are you feeling now that it's submitted?"

**Response:** My cohort is organizing a hot pot dinner for next week. First time they've included me in something social — usually they forget the old lady in the corner. I'm looking forward to it more than I probably should. Haven't had good hot pot in months.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-30

The hot pot was wonderful. Crowded restaurant, too loud to hear anything, steam fogging my glasses every time I reached for the lamb slices. Xiao-Wei sat next to me and we discovered we both grew up eating the same brand of sesame paste that nobody makes anymore.

Funny how food carries so much. My mother used to mix that paste into noodles on cold days. Now I'm in a room full of people young enough to be my children, fishing mushrooms out of boiling broth, and for two hours I wasn't thinking about deadlines or hospital appointments or whether I'm falling behind.

I ordered a second round of the taro dumplings even though nobody asked. Sometimes you have to be the one who says "let's keep going." They didn't seem to mind.

Walked home through the night market after. Bought a bag of pineapple cakes I definitely don't need. Didn't feel guilty about it even once.

**Nudge:** "This sounds different from the weekend at your daughter's."

**Response:** It is different. No one needed me to be anywhere else. No responsibility I was avoiding by being there. I was just having dinner because I wanted to, with people who expected nothing from me except to pass the chili oil.

Maybe that's the permission I've been missing — not from anyone else but from the situation itself. When there's no competing obligation, the enjoyment feels clean.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-07

My brother called this morning to remind me that Mother's 80th birthday is in three weeks and "everyone is expecting a proper celebration." By everyone he means himself and the cousins who haven't visited her in months. By proper celebration he means I'll be the one booking the restaurant, organizing the guest list, and making sure the gift is tasteful enough to photograph.

I told him I'm in the middle of my comprehensive exams and he laughed. Actually laughed. Said something about how I could take a break from "playing student" for one day.

I hung up on him. First time I've ever done that. My hands were shaking.

I know I should call back and smooth things over. That's what I always do. But I'm so tired of being the one who manages his feelings while he dismisses mine.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-07

Three hours later and I still haven't called him back. My husband thinks I'm overreacting. "He didn't mean it that way," he said. "You know how he is."

Yes. I know exactly how he is. I've known for fifty years. That's precisely the problem.

When I gave up my career advancement to take care of our father during his illness, my brother sent flowers. When I spent six months coordinating Mother's hip surgery and recovery while working full time, my brother called on weekends. When I finally, finally decided to do something entirely for myself — to pursue this degree I've wanted since I was thirty — he treats it like a hobby I can set aside.

I'm not even angry at him specifically anymore. I'm angry at the role I've been assigned in this family, the one I keep accepting because the alternative feels like abandoning people I love. The reliable one. The one who handles things. The one whose own aspirations come last because someone has to hold everything together.

My chest hurts. I should make tea and calm down but I don't want to calm down. I want to stay angry long enough to remember this feeling the next time I'm tempted to say yes to something I don't have room for.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to not be the reliable one?"

**Response:** Terrifying. And also, maybe, free?

I think about my classmate Hui-Fang who went to Portugal last month just because she wanted to see the ocean. She didn't ask permission or coordinate schedules. She just booked a ticket and went.

I can't even imagine making a decision that clean. Every choice I make has to pass through a filter of who else it affects, who will be disappointed, who will need me to be somewhere else. I've been doing it so long I don't know if I'd recognize myself without it.

But there's something appealing about the idea of someone else handling Mother's birthday. Just this once. Just to see what happens.

Called my brother back. Told him I'd handle the restaurant booking but the guest list and gifts are his responsibility this year. He sputtered but eventually agreed.

Then I made myself a proper cup of oolong and sat on the balcony watching the city lights come on. It's cold but I wrapped myself in the blanket my daughter gave me and stayed out there until the tea was gone.

Small rebellion. Small pleasure. Both felt earned.

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-11

Comprehensive exams tomorrow. Studied at the library until closing, then walked the long way home through the park where the winter jasmine is blooming.

Stopped for beef noodle soup at my usual place. The owner remembered my order — extra green onion, light on the chili. There's something comforting about being known.

Feel as ready as I'll ever be.

**Nudge:** "What's going through your mind tonight?"

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-14

Passed. The committee seemed genuinely interested in my research, asked questions I hadn't anticipated but could answer because I've been living inside this topic for two years. Dr. Huang said my clinical experience brought a perspective the literature lacks. Coming from him, that means something.

Called my mother first. She asked if this meant I was finally finished and I had to explain that no, there's still the dissertation, probably two more years. She sighed and said at least I'd be a doctor eventually and she could tell her mahjong friends. I'll take it.

My daughter sent flowers. Pink lilies and a card that said "So proud of you, Mom." I cried in my office for a solid five minutes.

Tonight my husband is taking me to the French restaurant we've been saying we'll try for a year. White tablecloths, a tasting menu, the whole indulgence. I bought a new dress — dark green, silk blend, probably too expensive. I'm going to enjoy every course without thinking about calories or cost or whether I should be home checking on Mother.

For once, I'm just going to let myself have the moment.

This degree might be a vanity project. It might be impractical at my age. It might mean missing things, disappointing people, constantly negotiating between who I want to be and who everyone needs me to be.

But today, sitting in that conference room, defending ideas I've been developing for two years — I felt like the version of myself I imagined when I was twenty-five and too afraid to try. She showed up after all. Just took her a few decades.
