The gallery wants to change the whole color palette for the installation, said it's "too somber for the spring collection." Spring collection. Like my work is a handbag.

**Nudge:** "What matters most to you about this piece?"

**Response:** It's about plastic waste in the North Sea. If I make it cheerful and decorative, I'm just adding to the noise. The discomfort is the point.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-02

Spent the weekend at the refugee art workshop. We had twelve participants this time, up from eight last month. One woman, Fatima, has been coming consistently since October. She doesn't speak much Dutch yet, but her drawings are extraordinary - detailed botanical illustrations of plants from her home region in Syria that she does from memory.

I brought some of my old nature journals from when I was her age, thinking we might find common ground. We sat together for most of the afternoon, not really talking, just drawing side by side. At one point she reached over and corrected my shading technique on a leaf. I was the student.

The session ran two hours over. I had planned to work on my installation sketches this evening, but I sat in the car for twenty minutes before driving home, just thinking about those plants that no longer exist where she once lived. The commission deadline feels less urgent somehow, even though I know it shouldn't.

**Nudge:** "What shifted for you in that car?"

**Response:** I was thinking about permanence. My gallery piece will be dismantled in three months. Fatima's drawings preserve something real that's been destroyed. I started questioning whether my environmental commentary means anything compared to someone actually documenting loss.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-07

Just got off a call with my sister. She asked when I'm going to "get serious" about retirement planning. I'm 52. I have a studio, commissions, work that matters. But because I don't have a pension and a holiday fund, I'm apparently not a real adult.

She means well. I know she worries. But every conversation becomes a referendum on my life choices. Her husband works in insurance, they have a nice house in Utrecht, the kids are in good schools. And I have paint under my fingernails and a second-hand car. Different doesn't mean wrong.

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-07

Later the same day. Maybe the call bothered me more than I admitted. I do think about money sometimes. Not having it, I mean.

**Nudge:** "What does security actually look like to you?"

**Response:** Not what my sister has. But maybe enough to not panic when a commission falls through. I've been pretending money doesn't matter because wanting it feels like a betrayal of why I do this.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-12

Long week. The gallery accepted my color choices after I sent them a three-page explanation of the concept. They didn't love it, but they agreed. Small victory. I should feel satisfied but mostly I feel tired.

The nonprofit board meeting ran three hours last night. We're losing our main funder and no one can agree on next steps. Half the board wants to chase corporate sponsors, half thinks that compromises our mission. I sat there thinking about how much simpler it was when I just showed up and ran workshops. Now there's strategy and stakeholders and "capacity building."

**Nudge:** "What's getting squeezed out by all this?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-17

Saw the question about what's getting squeezed. I'm not avoiding it. I just don't have a neat answer. My studio time, obviously. Maybe that's fine for now.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-21

Good day in the studio. Lost track of time, which hasn't happened in weeks. The installation is finally taking shape the way I imagined it.

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-25

Installation opens next week and I'm behind. Skipped the workshop on Saturday to finish the main panel, which was the right choice for the deadline but felt wrong in a different way. Fatima asked after me, apparently. One of the other volunteers said she seemed disappointed.

I've been telling myself that the artwork has meaning beyond just me, that it might change how someone sees the world. But sitting here at midnight with resin fumes and sore hands, I wonder if I'm just making excuses for choosing my career over the people I said I cared about.

**Nudge:** "Is this a one-time choice or a pattern?"

**Response:** Pattern. I know it's a pattern. The teaching job, my marriage, now this. I keep choosing work. I tell myself it's because the work matters, but maybe I just find people harder.

## Entry 8 - 2025-02-28

Opening night went well. Several pieces sold. A journalist from NRC wants to interview me about the environmental themes.

---

## Entry 9 - 2025-02-28

Same day, later. The opening was a success by every external measure and I spent the last hour sitting in my studio in the dark.

A collector asked me to explain the piece about North Sea plastic. I gave my usual explanation - the scope of the problem, the research, the materials I used. He nodded, bought the piece, and then asked if I could do something similar but "more hopeful" for his holiday home. I smiled and said I'd think about it.

I should have said no. I should have said art isn't interior decoration. But I need the money, and he wasn't wrong that people want hope. And maybe I'm the one who's wrong, clinging to this idea that discomfort creates change when actually people just look away.

I keep thinking about what I said in the last question - that I choose work because people are harder. But tonight I chose people, in a way. I performed the version of myself that makes sales and connections. And I hate it, but I also felt this relief that it was working, that maybe I don't have to be so uncompromising about everything.

**Nudge:** "What would uncompromising cost you right now?"

**Response:** Probably the commission. Maybe more. But also - and I hadn't thought this through until now - it might cost me this idea that my choices are purely principled. Some of my stubbornness is just fear of doing it wrong in a different way.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-02

Went back to the workshop today. Fatima was there. She showed me the drawing she finished while I was away - a complete botanical study of a flower I don't recognize, maybe something that grew near Aleppo. We didn't talk about my absence.

I'm tired in a good way tonight. The kind of tired from doing something rather than just worrying about all the things I'm not doing. I emailed the collector to say I'd think about his commission but couldn't promise "hopeful" - I could only promise honest. He hasn't replied. That's probably fine.
