# Persona dd3e3d44: Liesel Bergmann

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** dd3e3d44
- **Name:** Liesel Bergmann
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Nurse
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Achievement
- **Bio:** Liesel works the cardiac ward at a teaching hospital in Munich, tracking her patient outcomes in a personal spreadsheet she updates every shift. She's been eyeing the charge nurse position for eighteen months now, staying late to mentor students and volunteering for extra certifications, while her partner increasingly eats dinner alone. Last month she was passed over for the promotion in favor of a colleague with more seniority, and she hasn't told anyone how much that stung.

## Entry 0 - 2025-05-28

Got the feedback from Dr. Weiss today about the cardiac arrest protocol I revised. He actually read the whole thing. Said it was thorough, well-researched, that he'd pass it to the department head for review. I stood there nodding like it was no big deal but inside I was buzzing. This is the first time anyone senior has taken something I wrote seriously.

I've been working on that protocol for three months. Stayed after shifts, dug through research papers during lunch, ran the numbers on our ward's response times. Most of it I did on my own time because nobody asked me to. I just wanted to prove that I could contribute beyond bedside care. That I'm not just someone who checks vitals and changes IV bags.

After he left I went to the break room and just sat there for a minute. Didn't even get coffee. Just needed a second to let it land. It felt real. Like something I made mattered.

Picked up two extra shifts this week. Covered for Anja on Tuesday and stayed late Thursday for the new grad's first code situation. She froze at the monitors and I had to talk her through it step by step while doing compressions. Afterwards she thanked me and I told her that's just how it goes the first time.

Thomas made a comment about never seeing me anymore. Fair. I've been home maybe four evenings this month. But the ward is short-staffed and I'm trying to show I can handle the load. Being reliable matters when you're trying to move up.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-07

Normal week. Two admissions, one discharge, one transfer to ICU. Ran the morning handoffs all five days since Monika was out sick. Nobody commented on it, which is fine. That's the job.

Had coffee with Klara from the surgical ward. She asked how I was doing since "the thing" — meaning Frau Hartmann getting the charge position instead of me. I said fine. She looked at me like she didn't believe it. I changed the subject to her holiday plans.

**Nudge:** "What would believing it have looked like?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-10

Checked the intranet again. Still no updates on the junior ward manager posting. Refreshed it three times during break like that would change anything. Felt stupid afterwards.

**Nudge:** "Why stupid?"

**Response:** Just impatient I guess. Nothing unusual.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-15

Thomas said something last night about me always being on my phone even when I'm home. He wasn't wrong, but the way he said it — like I'm doing something wrong by checking work emails — rubbed me the wrong way. I didn't pick a fight about it. Just said okay and put the phone down. But I kept thinking about it.

It's not like I want to be checking emails at 9pm. There's just always something. A shift swap request, a question from one of the students, updates about policy changes. If I don't stay on top of it I fall behind. And falling behind means being invisible.

**Nudge:** "What happens if you're invisible?"

**Response:** Then what was the point of any of it. The overtime, the extra certifications, the protocol work. I can't just be average.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-20

Double shift yesterday. Started at 6am, didn't leave until almost midnight. We had a patient crash twice within four hours — Herr Müller, 67, the one with the triple bypass last week. Both times I was the first to respond. Both times we got him back. The second time I couldn't even feel my hands afterwards, just this hollow buzzing in my arms.

Dr. Weiss pulled me aside at the end. I thought he was going to say something about the protocol, maybe some feedback finally. Instead he asked if I was okay. Told me I looked exhausted. That I should take my full breaks. I nodded and said I was fine.

On the U-Bahn home I stared at my reflection in the dark window. Couldn't remember the last time I ate an actual meal during a shift. Or the last time I left on time. There's a performance review coming up next month and I keep thinking if I can just get there, if I can just hold on until then, it'll be worth it. But I don't know anymore.

**Nudge:** "What would make it worth it?"

**Response:** The title. The recognition. I don't know, proof that it mattered.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-26

Frau Hartmann asked me to train the new hires on the cardiac monitoring system next week. She said I'm the best on the ward with the equipment and the documentation. Part of me was annoyed — I trained her on half of this stuff two years ago, and now she's delegating it back to me as if she invented it.

But I said yes. What else am I going to say? It's exposure. It's a chance to show the department head what I can do. Even if it means staying late again. Even if Thomas will eat dinner alone again. This is how it works. You don't get anywhere by saying no.

**Nudge:** "What would saying no feel like?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-26

Thomas asked if I wanted to go to his cousin's wedding in August. I said I'd have to check my shifts. He didn't respond. Just went to bed. I stayed up looking at the calendar knowing I could probably make it work but not wanting to commit.

**Nudge:** "What are you waiting for?"

## Entry 8 - 2025-07-03

Finished the training sessions. Got positive feedback from all four new hires. One of them said I made the defibrillator protocols actually make sense. Small win.

## Entry 9 - 2025-07-03

Realized I forgot our anniversary was yesterday. Thomas didn't say anything. Just made dinner like normal. I should have remembered. I had a reminder in my phone but I dismissed it during a shift and never looked again.

**Nudge:** "What did you feel when you realized?"

---

## Entry 10 - 2025-07-07

Performance review scheduled for Friday. Spent the evening updating my self-assessment document. Listed all the overtime, the certifications, the protocol work. Looks good on paper. Should be enough.

**Nudge:** "Enough for what?"
