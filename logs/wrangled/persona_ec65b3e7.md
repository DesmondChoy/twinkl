## Entry 0 - 2025-04-14

Spent four hours in the lab today processing sediment samples from Kitsilano Beach. Found microplastic concentrations three times higher than what we documented last summer. Dr. Chen asked if there's contamination in my process but I triple-checked everything. The samples are clean, the problem is the beach. There's this moment where you're looking through the microscope and counting these tiny fragments and you realize each one is someone's bottle cap or grocery bag or takeout container that's never going away. It's just breaking down smaller and smaller until it's in the food chain permanently.

Had a meeting with my supervisor about narrowing my thesis scope. She wants me to focus on one beach, one season, make it manageable. But what's the point of documenting pollution in one location when the entire coastline is drowning in plastic? She's not wrong about needing to finish, but it feels like rearranging deck chairs. Every dataset I collect is just more evidence of something everyone already knows but no one with actual power seems willing to address. The recycling programs are a joke, the bans on single-use plastics have so many exceptions they're meaningless, and meanwhile I'm supposed to write a thesis that might get cited in another paper that might inform a policy that might get implemented in a decade.

**Nudge:** "what happens when you're counting those fragments?"

**Response:** Honestly just more of the same. Count, record, move to the next slide. Standard lab protocol.

Skipped the refugee center tonight because I was too tired from lab work. Sent them a text but still feel like garbage about it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-16

Actually no that's not true, I wasn't too tired, I just didn't want to go because Layla asked me last week why I'm always so distracted during the lessons and I didn't know what to say. She's right though. I show up and I go through the motions but half the time I'm thinking about sample processing or upcoming deadlines or the fact that even if every single person in that room becomes fluent in English and gets a good job and builds a life here, sea levels are still rising and crop failures are still going to trigger more displacement and more conflict over resources. It's not their fault. They're dealing with enough without me projecting my climate anxiety onto their English pronunciation.

I used to think teaching was the most direct way to help actual humans instead of just generating data. Faces instead of numbers. But lately I sit there helping someone practice past tense verb conjugations and I'm thinking about the IPCC report I read last week about how we're on track for 2.7 degrees of warming and what that means for the regions most of these folks are from. They're already refugees from one crisis and we're barreling toward making it so much worse. And here I am teaching them "I walked to the store" when what they need is a government that will actually process their asylum claims and a global economy that doesn't treat their home countries as resource extraction zones.

**Nudge:** "what made Layla's comment land differently?"

**Response:** Because usually I can compartmentalize better. Research brain, volunteer brain, keep them separate. But she named something I've been trying to ignore.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-22

Beach cleanup this morning with the high school group and it was fine until it wasn't. We collected 47 pounds of trash in two hours which sounds impressive except we've been doing this same beach monthly for eight months and the amount never goes down. We just pull stuff out and the tide brings more in. One of the kids, Marcus, asked me if this actually makes a difference and I gave him the standard answer about how every piece we remove is one less piece breaking down into microplastics, every action matters, collective effort, all of that.

But he looked at me like he could tell I didn't fully believe it and honestly he's not wrong. We're doing cleanup with biodegradable bags and reusable gloves which is great but then half the kids showed up with plastic water bottles and drove here in their parents' SUVs and I drove here too because the bus doesn't run early enough on Saturdays. So we're performing environmental consciousness while still embedded in all the systems that create the problem. And it's not their fault, they're kids, they're showing up which is more than most people do. But sometimes it feels like we're all just playing at caring because actually caring would require restructuring everything about how we live and nobody's ready for that conversation.

Marcus is a smart kid. He deserves a better answer than the one I gave him. But what am I supposed to say? That his generation is inheriting a crisis my generation didn't create but also isn't fixing? That the beach cleanups are basically grief management disguised as activism?

**Nudge:** "what answer did Marcus deserve to hear?"

**Response:** Something honest, probably. But not from me on a Saturday morning when I'm supposed to be the adult keeping morale up.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-22

Okay reading that back I sound like I'm spiraling but I'm actually fine. Went for a run after the cleanup and it helped clear my head. The work does matter, even if it's incremental. The data I'm collecting will contribute to the larger body of evidence. The kids at the beach cleanup are building habits and awareness that they'll carry forward. The folks at the refugee center are learning skills that genuinely help them navigate a new country. None of it is solving everything but that's not the standard.

I think I've been putting too much pressure on every individual action to justify itself against the scale of the whole crisis, which is obviously impossible. Dr. Chen keeps saying that science is about documenting reality clearly so that policymakers have the information they need to act. My job is the documentation part, not the policy part. And with the volunteering, my job is just to show up and be present and helpful in the specific ways I can be helpful. Not to solve displacement or climate change or any of the massive systemic things.

It's fine to care about the bigger picture but I can't let that paralyze the smaller things that are actually within my control. Marcus and Layla both picked up on me being scattered because I've been scattered. But that's fixable. I just need to be where I am when I'm there instead of always three steps ahead catastrophizing about things I can't personally fix.

**Nudge:** "what does being where you are look like practically?"

**Response:** Phone away during tutoring sessions. Actually listening when the kids at cleanup talk instead of running through my mental to-do list. Treating each sample like it matters instead of going through motions.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-24

My mom called tonight and asked when I'm going to be done with school and get a "real job" and I know she doesn't mean it the way it sounded but god it's exhausting. She keeps sending me listings for environmental consultant positions at engineering firms that pay three times what I'll make in academia and I know she's trying to help, she wants me to be financially stable, but she doesn't get that those jobs are about helping corporations comply with minimum regulations while still maximizing extraction. Like yes I could make good money helping a mining company file the right environmental impact paperwork but that's not why I'm doing this.

Tried to explain that my research contributes to the scientific understanding that drives actual policy change and she said "policy doesn't pay your loans." Which is true and also completely missing the point. I have loan debt, everyone has loan debt, that's not a reason to abandon work that matters for work that just makes things worse in a more profitable way. She grew up in a generation where you could have a stable middle-class life with a normal job and she doesn't understand that those conditions don't exist anymore and also were built on systems that are destroying the planet anyway.

I know she loves me. I know she worries. But I cannot take a job helping oil companies greenwash their PR just so I can buy a condo and make her feel like I'm settled. Some things are more important than financial security and I wish she could understand that without making me feel guilty for choosing work that actually aligns with trying to make things less catastrophically bad for everyone.

**Nudge:** "more important than financial security - what does that look like for you?"

**Response:** Waking up and knowing the work I'm doing isn't actively making things worse. That sounds dramatic but it's true. I can't live with myself doing work I know is harmful just because it pays well. I'd rather be broke and able to look at myself in the mirror.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-30

Had a good session at the refugee center. Focused the whole time, no distractions. Worked with Hassan on his citizenship test prep and he's actually ready, he's going to pass easily. That's something concrete and real. A person who fled violence, navigated an impossible immigration system, and is about to become a citizen. That matters regardless of what else is happening in the world.

Same with the research. Finished processing the March samples and the data is solid. It'll be a good chapter. Dr. Chen was right about narrowing the scope. I can actually finish this if I stay focused on what I'm trying to document instead of trying to solve everything at once.

**Nudge:** "what shifted between last week and this week?"

**Response:** Honestly just lowered my expectations for what any one person can do. Sounds bleak but it's actually helping. I can do my work well or I can save the world. Not both.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-07

Sat in on a departmental seminar today about community-based participatory research and it was actually kind of revelatory. The speaker was talking about this project where they worked with Indigenous communities in Northern BC on water quality monitoring and the whole model was collaborative from the start. Not researchers extracting data from communities but communities identifying the questions that matter to them and researchers providing technical capacity to help answer those questions. The data belongs to the community, they decide how it gets used, and it's directly connected to their advocacy for pipeline regulation and watershed protection.

It made me think about how isolated I've been in my own research. I'm studying pollution that affects actual communities but I've never talked to anyone who lives near the beaches I'm sampling. I'm just collecting data to publish in journals that those communities will never read and that might eventually inform policies they have no input on. The whole model is backwards. What if I actually talked to the fisher folks and the community groups and the people who use these beaches about what questions matter to them? What would they want to know about microplastic contamination that I'm not even thinking to measure?

I mentioned this to Dr. Chen after the seminar and she was cautiously supportive but also pointed out that I'm already two years in and adding a community engagement component now would probably delay my graduation. Which is fair. But also maybe worth it? Or maybe that's something I build into whatever I do after this degree. I don't know. But the seminar gave me the first spark of actual excitement about this work in months. The idea that research could be in service of communities instead of just in service of adding to the academic knowledge base.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-14

My roommate Jen asked me tonight why I never come to parties anymore and I got kind of defensive about it which wasn't fair to her. She wasn't judging, she was just checking in. But I feel like I'm in this weird phase where most of the stuff people my age are doing just feels hollow. Like yes I could spend my Friday night at a bar spending money I don't have on drinks I don't need or I could spend it doing something that actually contributes something to someone. That sounds self-righteous and I don't mean it that way. People deserve to have fun and blow off steam. I just don't have the energy for it right now when there's so much work to do.

Jen pointed out that I used to be fun, which stung a bit but also is probably true. I used to go out, have hobbies, date occasionally, all the normal stuff. But somewhere in the last year that started feeling frivolous. Like how can I justify spending three hours at brunch talking about Netflix shows when I could be processing samples or tutoring or organizing the next beach cleanup? There are only so many hours in a day and I need to use them for things that matter.

I know rationally that rest matters too and that burning out doesn't help anyone. Jen said the same thing. But it's hard to relax when you're aware of how much isn't getting done. Someone needs to do this work and if I don't, who will? The world doesn't stop being on fire just because I'm tired. And yeah maybe that means I'm less fun at parties but honestly that feels like a reasonable trade-off for trying to be a person who's actually contributing something meaningful instead of just consuming and wasting and taking up space.

**Nudge:** "what happens if you stop doing the work for a weekend?"

**Response:** Nothing collapses. Samples wait, kids manage without one cleanup. But then what's my excuse for not doing it? If it can wait, am I just performing busyness to feel useful?

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-21

Took Jen's advice and actually took the weekend off. No lab, no volunteering, no beach cleanup. Just slept in, went to a farmers market, read a book that had nothing to do with environmental science. It was fine. Good, even. My brain feels less static-y.

I think I've been running on this assumption that constant work is the same as meaningful work, and it's not. Quality over quantity. Being present and focused when I am working instead of grinding through tasks while exhausted and resentful. Dr. Chen keeps saying that grad school is a marathon not a sprint and I've been sprinting for two years straight and wondering why I keep hitting walls.

Also went to the refugee center on Monday actually rested and it was a completely different experience. Talked to Layla about her job search and she told me about the hotel where she's interviewing and how nervous she is and I was actually there for that conversation instead of half-present. That's what she meant about me being distracted. I was performing helping instead of actually helping. Same with the beach cleanups. Marcus and the other kids don't need me to save the planet, they need me to show up and make the work feel worthwhile and maybe teach them some things about marine ecosystems. That's the actual job.

I can't fix everything and trying to is just making me worse at the specific things I can actually do. So new approach: do less, do it better, stop measuring my worth by how exhausted I am.

**Nudge:** "what does doing it better look like in practice?"

**Response:** Being fully engaged when I'm there. One good tutoring session beats three distracted ones. And maybe actually talking to people at the beach cleanups instead of just directing logistics. Connection over quantity.

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-25

Hassan passed his citizenship test. Got the news today and he was beaming, absolutely beaming. Showed me the letter and talked about bringing his sister over now that he has status and how he's going to apply for that job at the community center he's been eyeing. This is someone who survived things I can't even imagine, crossed borders and oceans, learned a new language, navigated a labyrinth of bureaucracy designed to keep people out, and he made it through. And I got to be a tiny part of that by helping him practice for the civics portion. That's not nothing.

It put things in perspective. I'm never going to single-handedly stop microplastic pollution or solve the refugee crisis or reverse climate change. But I can help Hassan learn English. I can teach Marcus about marine ecology while we pick up trash. I can collect data that adds to the body of evidence that other researchers and policymakers use. I can show up for the people and work directly in front of me and trust that collective effort from millions of people doing their small part is how anything big ever changes.

I think I've been so focused on the impossibility of the big picture that I lost sight of the actual humans and actual work that matters right now. The crisis is real and it's huge and it's urgent. But I'm one person with limited time and energy and the best thing I can do is use what I have where I am for the people and problems I can actually touch. That's not resignation, it's strategy. Stay in it for the long haul by not trying to do everything at once. Find the meaning in the specific, tangible moments instead of despairing over the abstract enormity of it all.

Hassan is a citizen now. That's real. The rest I'll figure out as I go.

**Nudge:** "what does long haul look like from here?"

**Response:** Finish the degree. Keep showing up for tutoring and cleanups. Maybe explore that community-based research model after graduation. Take weekends off occasionally. Stay in the work without letting it consume everything.
