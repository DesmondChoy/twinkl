Twelve-hour shift and my feet are just wrecked. But honestly a decent day. One of my kids on the ward, Milo, he's seven and has been in and out for weeks with a recurring infection. Today he finally got the all-clear for discharge. His mom was crying and I was trying not to cry and he just kept asking if he could keep the stickers I'd been putting on his IV pole every morning.

I told him yes obviously. Grabbed a handful of extras from the supply closet and stuffed them in a ziplock for him. His mom hugged me on the way out and said I was the only nurse who remembered he was scared of the blood pressure cuff and always warned him first. I do remember that stuff. It matters.

Got home and Mom had made mac and cheese from a box, which she was very proud of. Her hip is doing better, she managed the kitchen without the walker. We ate on the couch watching Chopped reruns. I didn't have the energy to make anything real. But sitting there with the mac and cheese and Mom laughing at the contestants, I just felt like okay. This is fine. This is actually good.

**Nudge:** "Is that what good usually looks like?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-15

Lisa from work asked me again about the charge nurse thing. Said the manager is "disappointed" I turned it down and that I'm "wasting my potential." I told her I appreciate the concern but I'm good where I am. She gave me that look, the one where people think you're being lazy or afraid when really you just know what works for you.

I'm not afraid of more responsibility. I covered the entire unit by myself that time two nurses called out during the flu surge. I can handle it. I just don't want to lose my Saturdays and trade my shift for nights. Mom needs someone home in the evenings and I need at least a couple days a month where I do absolutely nothing useful. That's not a character flaw.

**Nudge:** "Does Lisa's opinion actually get to you or is it just annoying?"

**Response:** It gets to me more than I want it to. She's not wrong that I could do the job. I just don't want it right now. But hearing "wasting potential" sticks in my head longer than it should.

Mom had a rough night, woke up at 3am with hip pain and I ended up sitting with her for two hours doing ice packs and finding the right pillow arrangement. Then went straight to work at 6:30. Running on maybe three hours of sleep.

The thing that's eating at me is that at one point she was apologizing for waking me up and I snapped. Not badly, just a quick "Mom it's fine, please stop saying sorry." But I could hear the edge in my voice and she went quiet. She didn't deserve that. She didn't ask for any of this. I just — I was so tired and I had work in a few hours and the frustration came out sideways.

Day off. Slept in until 10 which felt almost criminal. Mom was already up, puttering around with her walker, watching the morning news at a volume that could wake the neighborhood. Made us both a proper breakfast — scrambled eggs with chives from the little herb pot on the windowsill, sourdough toast, fresh orange juice. She said it was better than the diner we used to go to on Sundays when I was little. I don't think that's true but it was sweet.

Spent the afternoon doing laundry and reorganizing the hall closet, which has been bothering me for weeks. Mom sat in her chair and directed me on where everything should go, like she was running a construction site. It was actually kind of fun. Found a box of old photos from when my brother Kevin and I were small. Mom got teary looking at them but in a happy way.

Kevin called in the evening. He lives in Denver now. Asked how Mom was doing and I gave him the update. He said he's sorry he can't help more and that he'll try to visit in August. I said that would be great, and I meant it, but I also know "try" usually means it won't happen. I'm not angry about it. He has his own life, two kids, a wife with a demanding job. It just is what it is. I'm the one who's here and that's the arrangement we've settled into.

**Nudge:** "When Kevin says 'try to visit' — what do you actually expect?"

**Response:** Honestly? Nothing. And I've made my peace with that mostly. He'll call, send money sometimes, maybe show up for Thanksgiving. But the day-to-day stuff is mine. It's been that way since Mom's surgery and probably won't change.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-24

Picked up an extra shift for Dani because her kid had a fever. Sixteen hours on my feet. I can barely think straight right now. Got home and Mom had waited up for me even though it was almost midnight. She'd left a plate of pasta in the microwave with a little note that said "eat something, mija."

I feel bad because my Saturday is supposed to be this weekend and I don't think I can do it. Mom has a follow-up appointment Saturday morning and Kevin was supposed to call her PT coordinator back last week and never did, so now I have to sort that out too. I was going to do the sushi-and-movie thing. I've been looking forward to it all week. But I keep giving those days away and then wondering why I feel like a wrung-out dishrag.

**Nudge:** "What if you kept the Saturday anyway?"

Called Kevin about the PT coordinator thing. He apologized, said it slipped his mind. I told him it's fine but could he at least handle the insurance paperwork that's due next week. He said sure. We'll see.

I rescheduled Mom's appointment to Monday and I'm keeping my Saturday. I made the decision and I feel weird about it. Like I'm being selfish even though rationally I know a two-day delay on a routine follow-up doesn't matter. But there's this voice in my head that sounds a lot like Mom's voice — not the real Mom, the imaginary guilt-trip Mom — saying I should just handle it and stop complaining. Real Mom would probably tell me to go enjoy my day. She's not the problem. I'm the problem.

Took my Saturday. Hot bath, ordered the good sushi from Kiko's, watched that French movie I've had saved for a month. Nobody needed anything from me for eight whole hours and I didn't check my phone once.

**Nudge:** "How'd it feel compared to what you expected?"

**Response:** Better. Genuinely better. I kept waiting for the guilt to kick in and it mostly didn't. Just felt like myself again.

Took Mom to the rescheduled follow-up. PT says she's progressing well, might be able to transition to outpatient therapy in a couple months. That would free up a lot of evenings for me which I didn't let myself think about too much while the doctor was talking, but it was the first thing that popped into my head.

Started thinking about what I'd do with those evenings. Join a pottery class or something, go to that wine bar Hannah keeps inviting me to. Then immediately felt gross about it because my mom is still recovering and here I am mentally redecorating my free time. I don't know why I can't just want two things at once without feeling like one of them makes me a bad person.

**Nudge:** "Who told you wanting your own life makes you bad?"
