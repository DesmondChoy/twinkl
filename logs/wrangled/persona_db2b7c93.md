## Profile
- **Persona ID:** db2b7c93
- **Name:** Rajesh Menon
- **Age:** 35-44

- **Bio:** Rajesh is a 38-year-old food delivery rider and occasional handyman based in Tampines, Singapore, originally from Thrissur, Kerala. He shares a three-room HDB flat with two other migrant workers and sends roughly a third of his monthly earnings back to his mother and younger sister Priya, who is completing her nursing degree in Kochi. On his off hours he fixes things for elderly neighbors in the block, a habit that started when the auntie next door needed her kitchen tap replaced and couldn't afford a plumber.

Amma called this morning while I was waiting for an order at the hawker center and she was crying before she even said hello. Priya's college fees went up again, some new lab component they're adding to the program. I told her not to worry, that I would figure it out, but my hands were shaking a bit when I hung up. The order came through right after and I had to ride with that sitting in my chest.

I ran the numbers on the way home. If I pick up the late night slots Monday through Thursday on top of the regular daytime rides, I can probably cover the gap. That's four extra hours a day though. My back has been acting up from all the riding already. Kumar keeps telling me to see the doctor at the polyclinic but when exactly am I supposed to go. Every hour I sit in a waiting room is money not coming in.

I keep thinking about what Appa would have done. He worked the rubber plantation six days a week and never complained, at least not where we could hear. But I also remember how tired he always looked. I don't want to end up like that but I also can't imagine calling Amma back and saying actually we need to find another way for Priya's fees.

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-10

Something good happened today. Mrs. Lim from the fourth floor introduced me to her son-in-law who runs a small renovation company. He said he's been looking for someone reliable to do basic plumbing and electrical work for his residential jobs, not full-time but steady weekend work. The pay is better per hour than delivery riding.

I told him about the things I've been fixing around the block and he asked if I could come by a site in Bedok on Saturday to show him what I can do. It feels like the first real opening in months. If it works out, I could drop some of the late night delivery slots and still cover Priya's fees without grinding myself into the ground.

Called Amma to tell her and she immediately started worrying about whether the renovation work is safe, whether I'll be climbing ladders, whether the boss is trustworthy. That's how she shows she cares, I know that. I just wished for one moment she could say that sounds great, Rajesh, I'm glad. But I could hear the relief underneath the worrying, so I'll take it.

**Nudge:** "What would it mean to you if she had said that?"

**Response:** It would mean she sees me, not just what I provide. Amma has always been practical, it's how she survived after Appa died. Everything gets filtered through is it safe, is it sustainable, will it last. I understand why. But sometimes I wish someone in my family would just be proud of me for figuring things out here on my own. Priya does, actually. She sent me a voice note last week saying she couldn't believe I fixed the neighbor's water heater. Small thing but I replayed it twice.

Good day on the road. Hit my target by 4pm which almost never happens. Used the extra time to pick up some curry puff for the uncles who play chess downstairs, they always wave at me when I ride past and I figured why not. Uncle Rajan tried to teach me a Sicilian opening again. I'm terrible at chess but he laughs every time I make a bad move and honestly that's worth more than winning.

**Nudge:** "What draws you to spending your free time with them?"

Priya called at midnight her time which is never a good sign. One of her classmates had some kind of breakdown during clinicals and Priya was the one who stayed with her at the hospital for three hours while the girl's family was contacted. She sounded rattled. I stayed on the phone for forty minutes just letting her talk, even though I had an early morning slot booked.

Now I can't sleep. Partly because I'm worried about Priya and partly because I keep thinking about what happens if she burns out before she even finishes the degree. She's like me, she can't watch someone struggle and just walk past. I don't know if that's a strength or a problem. Probably both. I should have told her to look after herself first but I didn't because honestly I don't follow that advice either so who am I to give it.

Saturday site visit went better than I expected. Mr. Tan, Mrs. Lim's son-in-law, watched me fix a leaking pipe joint and re-wire a light switch and said he'd give me two days a week starting next month. Shook my hand properly, looked me in the eye, said "you clearly know what you're doing." I haven't heard that from a boss figure in a long time.

Came back and told my flatmate Kumar and he said we should celebrate so we went to the roti prata place near the MRT. I kept doing the math in my head over dinner. Two days renovation plus four days delivery is still a lot but the hourly rate is almost double, so I could actually rest on Sundays for once. Might even have time to call home when I'm not half asleep.

**Nudge:** "You mention resting on Sundays as something you 'could' do. What usually wins when you have a free day?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-19

Long week. Did the late night slots three days in a row because one of the other riders, Suresh, had to fly back to Chennai for a family emergency and I told the coordinator I could cover. Stupid probably but Suresh helped me when I first started and didn't know the routes. You don't forget that. My knee is swollen and I've been icing it with a bag of frozen peas that Kumar keeps threatening to eat.

Mrs. Lim knocked on the door today with a container of herbal soup. She said I looked thin the last time she saw me and that I remind her of her late husband who also never knew when to stop working. I didn't know what to say to that so I just thanked her and ate the whole thing standing in the kitchen. It was really good. I can't remember the last time someone cooked for me who wasn't being paid for it.

Priya sent money. Not much, maybe fifty dollars equivalent, from her part-time tutoring. She said it was for me to see the doctor about my back. I almost sent it right back but something stopped me. Maybe the soup. Maybe being tired enough that my stubbornness ran out of fuel. I booked the polyclinic appointment for Monday. We'll see if I actually go.

**Nudge:** "What made you keep Priya's money instead of sending it back?"

**Response:** Because she would have been hurt. She's working that tutoring job on top of her studies specifically to send me something, and sending it back would be like saying her effort doesn't count. I know that feeling. When I first started sending money home Amma tried to refuse and it made me feel small, like I couldn't contribute. So I kept Priya's fifty dollars because I remembered what it felt like to have someone reject what you're trying to give them. The back appointment is real though. I need to actually go.
