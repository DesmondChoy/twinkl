# Persona 1f86f569: Erik Lindqvist

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 1f86f569
- **Name:** Erik Lindqvist
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Software Engineer
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Self-Direction, Conformity
- **Bio:** Erik is a 38-year-old backend developer at a mid-sized fintech company in Stockholm. He joined seven years ago when the team was small and scrappy, but now finds himself navigating layers of process and approval chains that didn't exist when he started. At home, his wife Maja and their two kids (ages 6 and 9) keep a tight family schedule that revolves around school pickups, weekend football practice, and Sunday dinners at his in-laws' place. Erik often stays up late working on side projects in Rust or Go, languages he taught himself because his day job keeps him locked into legacy Java codebases.

## Entry 0 - 2025-11-27

Had a one-on-one with my manager today where he brought up the new "technical design review board" they're implementing. Starting in January, any architectural change needs to go through a committee of three senior engineers before we can even start coding. I nodded along and said it made sense for quality control, but inside I was thinking about how this is the third approval layer they've added this year.

Part of me gets it. We've had incidents. There's regulatory pressure. The team has grown from 12 to 45 people and you can't have everyone doing their own thing. But I miss the days when I could just have an idea, prototype it over a weekend, and ship it by Wednesday if it worked.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

Spent the entire morning in back-to-back meetings about the new microservice architecture. Everyone has opinions, nobody wants to make a decision, and we ended up exactly where we started. I finally just said "look, why don't I build a proof of concept this week and we can evaluate from there?" My tech lead looked uncomfortable and reminded me we need to follow the new process.

The thing is, I know the process exists for good reasons. Last year Tomas pushed that caching change without proper review and it took down production for three hours. But there's got to be a middle ground between chaos and paralysis. Came home irritated and Maja asked what was wrong. I said "nothing, just work stuff" because I didn't want to vent about the same complaints again.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned not wanting to vent to Maja again. How often do you find yourself holding back like that?"

**Response:** Probably more than I should. It's just that she's heard the same story before - Erik is frustrated at work, Erik thinks things should be different. At some point it starts to feel self-indulgent. She has her own stress with the kids' schedules and her job. I don't want to be the guy who comes home every day complaining about meetings and processes. So I just... keep it to myself, put the kids to bed, then tinker with my side projects until midnight. It's fine. It works.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-06

Sunday dinner at Maja's parents' place. Her father asked me about work and I gave the usual "it's going well, keeping busy" response. What I didn't mention was that I've been quietly looking at job postings this week. Nothing serious, just... looking. There's a startup in Gothenburg that's hiring senior engineers and their tech blog posts suggest they actually let people build things without eighteen layers of review.

But then I think about what leaving would mean. We bought this apartment two years ago specifically because it's close to Maja's parents and the kids' school. My in-laws help with pickup three days a week. The kids have their friends, their routines. And honestly, the current job pays well, has good benefits, and the people are mostly nice. It's just the bureaucracy that gets to me.

Over dinner, my father-in-law started talking about how his generation valued loyalty to employers and how job-hopping is "a young person's disease." I just smiled and nodded and said something about stability being important. Maja caught my eye across the table and I could tell she knew something was off, but we didn't talk about it in the car ride home. The kids were tired and there wasn't space for that conversation.

**Nudge:** "You smiled and agreed with your father-in-law about loyalty, while quietly browsing job postings. What's it like holding both of those at once?"

**Response:** Uncomfortable, if I'm being honest. I'm not sure if I was lying to him or to myself. Part of me does believe in loyalty - I've given this company seven years and I've built things I'm proud of. But another part of me wonders if loyalty is just another word for being afraid to rock the boat.

The thing is, I don't actually know if I'd be happier somewhere else, or if I'd just find new things to be frustrated about. Maybe the startup in Gothenburg would turn into the same bureaucratic mess in three years. Maybe the problem is that I want to do things my way and the world doesn't work like that when you're part of a team. I haven't figured that out yet.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-09

Submitted my first technical design document to the new review board today. It took me two hours to write up something I could have just built in four. Three diagrams, a risk assessment matrix, rollback procedures. The whole thing. And you know what? They approved it in the meeting with almost no changes. The tech lead even said it was "exactly the kind of thorough documentation we need."

I should feel vindicated but mostly I just feel tired. I did the thing. I followed the process. And now I get to actually code, which is what I wanted to do a week ago. Maybe this is just what being a senior engineer at a growing company looks like. You learn to work within the system instead of against it. On the way home I stopped to pick up the kids from football practice and my daughter asked if I could help her build a website for her school project. I said yes immediately. At least that's one thing I can still build without a committee.
