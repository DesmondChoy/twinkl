# Persona 2da4f100: Santiago Herrera

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 2da4f100
- **Name:** Santiago Herrera
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Entrepreneur
- **Culture:** Latin American
- **Core Values:** Achievement
- **Bio:** Santiago runs a direct-to-consumer skincare brand out of Bogota that he bootstrapped with savings from his consulting years. He tracks monthly revenue, customer acquisition cost, and Instagram follower counts on a shared spreadsheet with his co-founder every Sunday morning. His girlfriend Laura has started calling Sunday mornings "the dashboard hour" because he won't look up from his laptop until the numbers are updated. He recently turned down an invitation to his cousin's wedding in Cartagena because it fell on the same weekend as a pitch competition he'd been preparing for since October.

## Entry 0 - 2025-01-23

Just got off a three-hour call with the fulfillment warehouse. They messed up the labels on two hundred units again. Second time this quarter. Spent the rest of the afternoon writing a detailed process document for them because apparently verbal instructions mean absolutely nothing to these people. My eyes hurt and I skipped lunch entirely.

Nothing dramatic happened today, just the slow grind of keeping everything from falling apart. Camilo was supposed to handle ops this week but he got pulled into a brand partnership meeting that ran long. So here I am, doing both. Normal Tuesday.

**Nudge:** "Does Camilo know you covered his ops stuff?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-29

Got into the Semana Emprendedora accelerator. Out of four hundred applicants, twenty-two got selected. I found out this morning and I just sat there staring at the email for a minute before telling anyone. Called my mom first. She cried. Then Camilo. Then Laura.

This is the first external proof that what we're doing is real. Not just two guys burning savings in a rented office. We got picked. Somebody looked at our numbers, our pitch, our traction, and said yes. That feels different from just believing in it yourself.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-04

First week of the accelerator done. We presented our metrics in front of the other cohort companies and the mentors. Our customer retention was the second highest in the room. I know because I checked everyone's slides. Only that sustainable fashion startup from Lima had us beat, and they've been operating two years longer.

It matters to me that I know where we stand relative to the others. Some people in the cohort seem content to just be "learning from the experience." I don't understand that. You're here to win something—funding, connections, credibility. If you're not tracking how you compare, what's the point? The mentors kept saying it's "not a competition," but everything is a ranking if you pay attention.

After the session I stayed late talking with one of the mentors, Adriana. She built a fintech company that got acquired in 2021. She told me my numbers were solid but asked me what happens when I burn out. I told her I don't burn out, I recalibrate. She laughed. Not sure if she was impressed or thought I was naive.

**Nudge:** "What did Adriana's laugh mean to you?"

**Response:** Honestly, it doesn't matter what she meant. She's been through it and she's testing whether I've got the mindset. Mentor-founder dynamics are like that. You perform confidence. That's the job.

Sunday dashboard session with Camilo. Revenue up 14% month-over-month and CAC is actually down for the first time since launch. Finally something moving in the right direction on both lines at once.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-09

Coming back to this because Laura and I got into it after the dashboard session. She wanted to go to brunch with her sister and I said I couldn't because I still needed to prep slides for Monday's accelerator check-in. She said I always say that. I told her the accelerator is twelve weeks and it's not forever. She said I said the same thing about the pitch competition, and before that it was the product launch.

She's not wrong that there's always something. But she's wrong that it's the same thing. Each one of these is a step. The pitch comp got us visibility. The launch got us revenue. The accelerator is getting us in front of investors. These aren't distractions from life—this is the thing. This is what I'm building.

I didn't say all that to her because it would've turned into a bigger fight. I just said I'd try to be done by two and we could go for a late lunch. She said fine. We went. It was fine. But I was checking my email under the table the whole time.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-15

Accelerator mid-point review. Each company got fifteen minutes with the mentor panel. They liked our growth but pushed back on our unit economics. Said our margins are tight and that scaling with the current supplier setup could squeeze us. I knew this already. I've been running those models for weeks. But hearing it said out loud in a room with the other founders stung more than I expected.

The sustainable fashion startup from Lima—Daniela's company—got praised for their margin structure. She came up to me after and said something supportive, which was nice, but I just kept thinking about why her numbers look cleaner. She has a family connection to a textile manufacturer. That's not hustle, that's a head start. I know comparing like that isn't productive but I can't stop the math from running in my head.

Camilo told me afterward that the feedback was constructive and that we're still in a strong position. He's right on paper. But I don't want to be in a "strong position." I want to be the one they point to when they talk about this cohort in two years.

**Nudge:** "What would being the one they point to actually get you?"

**Response:** Credibility. The kind that opens doors before you even walk through them. When investors hear "oh, he was the standout from Semana Emprendedora 2025," that changes the conversation before I even pitch. It's leverage. First-mover advantage in reputation.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-19

Skipped my cousin Mateo's wedding in Cartagena. Told my tia I had a work conflict. She didn't say anything but my mom called and I could tell she was disappointed.

**Nudge:** "Was it a conflict or a choice?"

**Response:** Both. The pitch competition was scheduled months before the wedding date was set. It's not like I picked one over the other—the timeline did.

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-19

We placed second at the pitch comp. Second. Out of sixty companies. The judges said our presentation was the most polished. Camilo and I just looked at each other after and didn't say anything for a solid minute. Then we went and got arepas.

## Entry 8 - 2025-02-25

Two investor meetings came out of the pitch comp. One is a seed fund out of Mexico City, the other is an angel based in Miami. Both want to see our full deck and projections by Friday. I've been working on it since 6 AM and it's almost midnight now. Camilo's handling the financial model while I'm doing the narrative and market slide.

This is what all the prep was for. Every late night, every Sunday dashboard session, every fight with Laura about brunch. This is the payoff runway. If we close even one of these, we go from bootstrapped to funded. We go from "interesting startup" to "company." The distinction matters. People take you seriously when there's money behind you. Suppliers negotiate differently. Hires return your calls.

Laura sent me dinner because she knew I wouldn't eat otherwise. She left a note that said "go get it." I almost cried, which is stupid, but it hit me at the right time. She gets it when it matters. I need to remember that next time I'm annoyed about brunch.

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-02

Mexico City fund passed. Said they loved the team but the market size wasn't big enough for their thesis. What does that even mean. Our TAM slide was solid.

**Nudge:** "What part of the rejection bothers you most?"

**Response:** That I can't argue with it. It's not about our performance or our product. It's about their model. I did everything right and it still wasn't enough because of something I can't control. That's the worst kind of no.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-08

Miami angel came through. Signed the term sheet yesterday. Everyone keeps asking if I'm relieved and I keep saying I'm focused. Relief is for people who doubted whether it would happen.

**Nudge:** "Who are you performing that confidence for right now?"

**Response:** Maybe myself. The Mexico City rejection hit harder than I let on. For about three days I was running scenarios where both funds passed and we had to go back to bootstrapping for another year. I didn't tell Camilo or Laura. I just kept updating the spreadsheet and running the numbers. When the Miami call came in, the first thing I felt was my shoulders drop. So yeah. Maybe relief is exactly what it was.
