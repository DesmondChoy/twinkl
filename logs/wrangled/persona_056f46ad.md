## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Today was my parents' 40th wedding anniversary, and I spent most of the afternoon at their villa helping coordinate everything. My mother had very specific ideas about the flower arrangements and the seating chart — cousin Layla absolutely cannot be seated near aunt Fatima after what happened at Eid — and I found myself nodding along, rearranging the entire dining room twice to meet her vision.

The funny thing is, I didn't mind. There's something calming about fitting into the role everyone expects. My father pulled me aside after the guests arrived and thanked me for "being the reliable one," and I felt this warmth in my chest. My younger brother Samir flew in from London but spent most of the party on his phone, and I could see the disappointment in my mother's eyes. I don't want to be the source of that look.

But there was this moment, late in the evening, when the older relatives were doing their formal toasts, and I looked across the room at my wife Nadia. She caught my eye and did this little mock-yawn behind her napkin, and I had to bite my cheek not to laugh. We'd both rather have been at that new seafood place on the Palm with a bottle of wine, just the two of us. Instead, I sat through two hours of my uncle's stories about the old days.

I think I'm okay with it. The party was beautiful. Everyone was happy. And Nadia and I are going to that restaurant next weekend anyway — I already made the reservation. You can do both, I think. Be the person your family needs and still carve out space for the things that make life sweet.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-09

I'm so frustrated I could scream. We had our quarterly review today and Hamza — my direct report who I've mentored for two years — threw me under the bus in front of the regional director. He presented his supply chain optimization idea as if it was entirely his own, when we literally developed it together over coffee last month. I was the one who told him to run the numbers on the Oman route!

The worst part is I just sat there. Smiled. Nodded along. When Ahmed, my boss, looked at me after the presentation, I said something supportive about Hamza's initiative. What else was I supposed to do? Create a scene? Interrupt him mid-presentation to claim credit? That's not how things are done. You don't embarrass a colleague publicly, especially one you outrank. It would look petty. Undignified.

But God, I wanted to. I wanted to say, "Actually, that was our idea, developed during our Tuesday coffees." Instead I shook his hand after and told him he did well. He had the grace to look slightly uncomfortable, at least.

Nadia says I should have spoken up privately to Ahmed afterward. She's probably right. But I keep thinking about how my father handled workplace conflicts — with patience, with letting things play out, with trusting that people eventually see the truth. Maybe Hamza will acknowledge it later. Maybe Ahmed already knows whose brain that idea came from.

Or maybe I'm just telling myself stories to feel better about being a coward. I don't know. I do know that I came home and ate an entire box of those pistachio sweets from that place in Sharjah, and I don't regret it one bit. Sometimes you just need something good after a bad day.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned Nadia's suggestion and your father's approach as two different paths. Which one feels more true to who you want to be?"

**Response:** Honestly? I think I'm overthinking this. It's one meeting. Hamza is young, he got excited about presenting something that worked. The idea will get implemented either way, and that's what matters for the team. I'd rather focus on the fact that we're on track for a really good Q4, and I'm taking Nadia to Bahrain for New Year's. Some things just aren't worth the energy of picking apart.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-18

Can't sleep. It's 2am and I'm sitting on the balcony with my laptop because Nadia's breathing is usually soothing but tonight it's just reminding me that everyone else can rest except me.

My mother called today and mentioned — casually, as if she was discussing the weather — that cousin Layla's husband just got made partner at his firm and isn't that wonderful, they're buying a bigger house in Abu Dhabi. Then she asked when Nadia and I are going to "settle down properly" and have children. I'm 41. We've been married six years. She knows we've been trying. She knows about the appointments with Dr. Khalil. But she still asks, every single time, like maybe if she reminds me enough, my body will cooperate.

I didn't say anything. I made the appropriate congratulatory noises about Layla's husband. I changed the subject to the marina and the boat engine I'm having fixed.

What I wanted to say was: we might not be able to have children, and it's breaking Nadia apart, and I feel like a failure every time she cries in the bathroom thinking I can't hear her. But you don't burden your mother with things like that. You don't make her worry. You don't disrupt the pleasant fiction that everything is fine and her eldest son has everything figured out.

The thing is, I don't even know if I want children anymore. Is that terrible? I used to. I had the whole picture in my head — teaching my son to fish, taking my daughter to her first day of school. But lately I've been thinking about what our life looks like without them. The freedom. The travel. The late Sunday mornings. Is that selfish? It feels selfish. But it also feels honest.

I should go back to bed. Nadia's got that look lately when I stay up too late, like she's worried about me. I don't want to give her another thing to worry about.

**Nudge:** "You described the picture you used to have and the one you're starting to imagine now. What would it take to talk about this with Nadia?"

**Response:** That's the thing — I'm not sure I can. We've never actually said out loud that it might not happen. We talk around it. We talk about appointments, and procedures, and "next steps." But we don't talk about what it means if there are no next steps. I think I'm afraid that if I tell her I'm starting to be okay with the idea of just us, she'll think I've given up on her. On us. On the future she wanted. And I haven't given up. I'm just... adapting? Protecting myself maybe? I don't know. I think I need to figure out what I actually feel before I bring it to her. Right now it's all just noise in my head at 2am.

Bahrain trip was good. Nadia and I finally talked about the fertility stuff. She cried but also seemed sort of relieved, I think? We're going to take a break from the treatments for a few months.

**Nudge:** "That sounds like a meaningful conversation to have had together. How are you feeling now that it's out in the open?"

**Response:** You know, mostly I'm just glad to be back at work tomorrow. The holiday period always feels long. We have the Q1 planning meeting on Thursday and I want to make sure the Oman route data is properly credited this time. Fresh start to the year.
