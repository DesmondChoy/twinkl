Helped Amira debug the intake form tonight at the nonprofit. She'd been stuck on a date-parsing issue for two days and we sorted it in twenty minutes. Small thing, but it felt like the right use of a Tuesday evening.

**Nudge:** "What made that feel like the right call?"

**Response:** Dunno, just better than watching Netflix again.

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-11

Team standup today. Felix made a comment about one of our logistics partners using subcontracted drivers with no fixed contracts, basically gig workers with zero protections. He said it casually, like it was just a business fact. I sat there and said nothing.

It's not like I didn't notice. I noticed immediately. But the meeting had twelve people in it and the product lead was driving the agenda and I just... let it slide. Afterwards I thought about saying something to Felix privately but then I got pulled into a deployment issue and the moment passed. I keep telling myself I'll bring it up tomorrow but I probably won't. It's easier to pretend I didn't hear it clearly.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you — the room, or something else?"

**Response:** Honestly the room. Twelve people, nobody else flinched.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-14

Booked a flight to Lisbon for August. Budget airline, the one that keeps getting flagged for its emissions record. I know this. I looked at the train option and it was fourteen hours and three times the price and I just couldn't justify it.

I'm tired of every small decision feeling like a referendum. The flight was sixty euros. The train would've eaten half my weekend travel budget. I picked convenience and cost and I'm sitting here feeling vaguely bad about it, which is stupid because one flight isn't going to tip the scales. But it adds up and I know it adds up and that's the part that nags at me.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-19

Lunch with Felix and Sandra. Sandra was talking about her new apartment in Schwabing and how she's glad the neighbourhood "hasn't changed too much," meaning it hasn't gotten more diverse. She didn't say it outright but the implication was clear. Felix nodded along.

I changed the subject to the upcoming sprint deadline. Could have said something. Should have, maybe. But Sandra is senior to me and she's leading the Q3 roadmap review. There's a calculation that happens in these moments and I went with the safe option. Finished my Kartoffelsalat and went back to my desk.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-25

The carbon audit thing. I finally got a response from Stefan in compliance. He said the numbers I flagged were "within acceptable reporting tolerances" and that the methodology was approved by their external auditor. End of conversation, apparently.

So I looked into it more. The tolerance band they're using is laughably wide — basically you can underreport by fifteen percent and still be compliant. It's technically legal. But the whole reason I pushed for the audit was because I thought the company would want to know the real numbers. Turns out they already know and they're fine with it. The system is designed to allow this.

I could escalate. Take it to the sustainability board or even the Betriebsrat. But I've been here eighteen months and I'm not in a position to make waves. And honestly, part of me is relieved that Stefan shut it down because now I have an excuse to stop. That's the part I don't like admitting. I chose the easier path — I got my answer, I can file it away, and nobody has to be uncomfortable. Including me.

The thing is, when I left the adtech job I told myself I wouldn't do this. I wouldn't just accept things that feel wrong because it's inconvenient to push. And here I am doing exactly that.

**Nudge:** "You said you felt relieved — what does that tell you?"

**Response:** That I want someone else to fight this one. Which is exactly the problem.

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-01

New contractor started on the team. Guy named Tomasz, Polish, here on a project-based contract. During onboarding someone made a joke about Eastern European work ethic — meant as a compliment, apparently. Tomasz laughed it off. I didn't say anything.

It's such a small moment. Probably wouldn't even register for most people. But I noticed the way Tomasz's laugh didn't quite reach his eyes and I thought about saying something after the meeting and then I didn't. Went back to my Jira tickets instead.

**Nudge:** "What would you have said to Tomasz?"

**Response:** Maybe just that I noticed. That he doesn't have to laugh at stuff like that here. But saying that out loud feels presumptuous, like I'm deciding what should bother him.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-07

Weird day in a good way. The nonprofit had their summer meetup at the Englischer Garten, just food and talking, nothing structured. I ended up sitting with this Syrian family I'd helped with their paperwork back in March, the Haddads. The dad, Marwan, was telling me about his daughter's school report — she got top marks in maths and he was so proud he was practically vibrating.

And there was this moment where he grabbed my arm and said something in Arabic to his wife and she smiled and he turned back to me and said "she says you are part of the story now." I didn't really know what to say to that. Just sat there eating my Falafel feeling like, okay, this is something real. Not a dashboard metric. Not a compliance tolerance. An actual family doing better because a few people showed up consistently.

I think about the work stuff — the carbon numbers, the things I don't say in meetings — and then I think about this afternoon and it's hard to hold both at the same time. But today was just good. Marwan's daughter got good grades and he wanted to tell me about it. That's enough for one Monday.

## Entry 7 - 2025-07-11

Had a one-on-one with my manager Katharina. She asked how I was finding the team culture and I actually said something. Told her the comment during Tomasz's onboarding bothered me and that I think we could be more careful about that kind of thing. She nodded and took a note and said she'd "keep an eye on it."

Not exactly a revolution. But I said it. Out loud. To someone with authority to do something. I've been replaying the conversation all evening trying to figure out if she took it seriously or just filed it under "Lukas is being sensitive." Probably overthinking it. The point is I didn't let it pass this time.

People at work probably think I'm easygoing because I don't argue in meetings. But easygoing and silent aren't the same thing. I've just been choosing silent for too long. Katharina's response wasn't dramatic — no promises, no action items — but she heard me. And I can live with that being the starting point.

Part of me wants to dismiss this as barely doing anything. Like, congratulations, you mentioned something mildly uncomfortable in a private meeting, what do you want, a medal? But no. I know what it cost me to say it and I know I wouldn't have done it two months ago.

## Entry 8 - 2025-07-12

Grocery run after work. Standing in Edeka staring at the coffee shelf. Fair trade option is almost double the price of the store brand. I know what the price difference means — it means someone down the supply chain is getting squeezed. I know this. I've read about it. I've shared articles about it.

Bought the store brand anyway. Forty euros left until payday and I'm not going to pretend that doesn't matter. But it's the same calculation I keep making. The flight to Lisbon. The compliance thing at work. There's always a reason to pick the easier option and the reason is always money or comfort or not wanting to be the difficult one.

I'm exhausted by the gap between what I think matters and what I actually do when it comes down to it. It's not even big moral failures. It's coffee. It's a budget airline. It's staying quiet at lunch. But it's all the same muscle and I keep not using it. And I'm too tired tonight to figure out what to do about that. Going to bed.

**Nudge:** "Is the gap getting bigger or smaller?"

**Response:** Honestly can't tell anymore. Some weeks smaller, some weeks it swallows everything.

Can't sleep. Keep thinking about how easily I let things go at work. Tomasz caught my eye in the hallway today and just nodded and I felt like a fraud.
