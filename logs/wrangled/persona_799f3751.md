## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 799f3751
- **Name:** Meera Sharma
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** South Asian
- **Core Values:** Conformity, Hedonism
- **Bio:** Meera is a stay-at-home mother of two young children in suburban Mumbai, married into a joint family where her mother-in-law lives with them. She gave up her marketing career three years ago when her first child was born, a decision that felt right at the time but now sometimes leaves her wondering. She finds small moments of joy in her morning chai before the kids wake up, in cooking elaborate weekend meals, and in the rare evening out with her college friends. She works hard to keep everyone happy—her husband, her in-laws, her children—but lately finds herself scrolling through old photos of office parties and wondering who she became.

## Entry 0 - 2025-05-18

Okay so today was one of those days where everything just sort of piled up and I don't even know where to start really. Woke up early because Arjun had a nightmare, then couldn't go back to sleep because my mind started racing about the lunch I'm supposed to make for the pooja tomorrow. Mummyji has her specific expectations you know, the dal has to be a certain consistency, the rice has to be this particular grain she likes, and I keep thinking about all the relatives who will be there judging every single dish I put out.

But here's the thing that's been bothering me all day—Priya messaged the group chat about going to that new spa place next weekend. The one with the aromatherapy and the hot stone massage. And I just... I really want to go? Like my shoulders have been killing me for weeks, carrying Aanya around, sleeping in weird positions when she has colds. I haven't done anything just for myself in so long. The last time was probably Diwali when I bought that kurta and even then I felt guilty about spending on something that wasn't for the kids.

I typed out "I'm in!" three times and deleted it each time. Because what will everyone think? Mummyji will do that thing where she doesn't say anything but you can tell she's disappointed. She'll mention something about how she never had time for "all this spa-shpa" when she was raising three kids. And my husband will probably be fine with it but then I'll have to coordinate everything—who will give Arjun his evening milk, what if Aanya doesn't nap for anyone else, all of that. It just seems like so much effort for a few hours of relaxation that I'll probably spend feeling guilty anyway.

But also... don't I deserve to feel good? My body hurts. I'm tired all the time. My friends are going and they keep saying I never come to anything anymore. I miss laughing with them about nothing. I miss being Meera who had opinions and went places and wasn't just someone's mother and someone's wife and someone's daughter-in-law.

I don't know. I'll probably say no. It's easier.

**Nudge:** "You deleted that message three times—what were you afraid would happen?"

**Response:** That's... actually a good question. I think I was afraid they'd say yes. Does that make sense? If I had sent it and they said "great, come!" then I'd have to actually make a choice. Right now I can tell myself I never really wanted to go anyway, it was just a passing thought. But if I commit, then I have to face my mother-in-law's silence, have to justify wanting three hours for myself, have to look at my husband and ask for help instead of just handling everything quietly. It's easier to be the one who sacrifices. Everyone expects it. Nobody questions it. The moment I want something, suddenly I'm the difficult one.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-20

Both kids have a stomach bug. I've been cleaning vomit since 3am. Lost count of how many sheet changes. Mummyji keeps hovering and suggesting home remedies that I know won't work but I just nod and say "yes, good idea" because I don't have the energy to argue. Husband took the morning off but had to go back for some urgent meeting so I've been solo since noon.

I keep thinking about that spa. Priya sent the confirmation today—they booked for Saturday. The message just sat there in my notifications while I was elbow-deep in laundry. I want to cry but even that feels like too much effort. All I want is to lie down somewhere quiet where nobody needs anything from me. Just for an hour. Is that too much to ask?

**Nudge:** "What went through your mind when you saw Priya's message?"

**Response:** Honestly? Jealousy. Burning jealousy. They're going to have mimosas and get massages and laugh and I'm here with sick children and sour laundry and my mother-in-law telling me for the fifth time that ajwain water fixes everything. I know it's not their fault. They don't have kids yet, their lives are different. But I just kept staring at that message thinking "that could have been me" and then immediately feeling guilty for even thinking that because my babies need me and I love them but god I'm so tired.

Kids are finally better. Mummyji made khichdi today without me asking—small gestures like this remind me she cares in her own way. Still thinking about the spa thing, wondering why it's so hard for me to just ask for what I want.

**Nudge:** "When's the last time you did ask?"

**Response:** I genuinely can't remember. Maybe when I was pregnant and asked for extra pillows? But even that felt like it was for the baby, not for me. Somewhere along the way I stopped asking. It was just easier to figure out how to not need things. Or to need smaller things that nobody would notice. Like my morning chai—I wake up twenty minutes early just so I can have that without anyone else's needs interrupting. That's my one thing. Twenty minutes of silence with a warm cup. Maybe that's enough. Maybe it isn't.
