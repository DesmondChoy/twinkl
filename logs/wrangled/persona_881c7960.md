# Persona 881c7960: Ricardo Espinoza

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 881c7960
- **Name:** Ricardo Espinoza
- **Age:** 45-54
- **Profession:** Software Engineer
- **Culture:** Latin American
- **Core Values:** Conformity, Achievement
- **Bio:** Ricardo is a 49-year-old senior software engineer at a mid-size fintech company in Mexico City. He emigrated from Colombia in his late twenties and built his career by being consistently reliable—never the loudest in the room but always the one who ships on time. He leads a backend team of six and has been passed over twice for the engineering director role, both times in favor of younger hires with flashier portfolios. He lives with his wife Camila and their two teenage daughters. Outside work he coaches his younger daughter's volleyball team and keeps a meticulous garden on their apartment balcony. He rarely voices disagreement in meetings, a habit his wife sometimes calls his "professional armor."

Long week. Delivered the payment gateway migration three days early and nobody said a word about it. Just got folded into the next sprint like it was expected. Meanwhile Tomás presented his dashboard prototype at the all-hands and got a round of applause. A prototype. Not even in production.

I'm not bitter about it. That's just how things work. You do the plumbing, someone else gets to show off the faucet. I knew that when I chose backend over product years ago.

Camila made tamales tonight. Sat on the balcony eating them while the girls did homework inside. The jalapeños she planted last month are actually coming up. Small green shoots pushing through the soil. That's the thing about growing something—it doesn't need anyone to clap for it. It just grows.

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-20

Monday standup, same routine. Gave my update, kept it short. Marcos asked if anyone had concerns about the new API rate-limiting approach and I almost said something. Almost. Because I think the threshold they picked is going to choke under real load. I ran the numbers over the weekend, actually. But Diego already endorsed the approach and Diego is the architect, so.

Funny how that works. You have the data, you have the experience, but you also have a sense of when speaking up will just make things awkward. Diego doesn't take pushback well. Everyone knows it. Nobody says it.

Went to the gym after work. Deadlifts. There's something honest about weight on a bar. Either you lift it or you don't. No politics in iron.

**Nudge:** "What would have happened if you'd spoken up?"

**Response:** Honestly, probably nothing dramatic. Diego would have nodded, said "good point, let's take it offline," and then nothing would change. That's the pattern. I've seen it enough times. It's not worth the energy to test it again. Better to document my concerns in the ticket comments so there's a paper trail when it breaks. That way I'm covered without making it a thing.

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-26

Performance review cycle opened today. I hate this time of year. You have to write a self-assessment that's basically a sales pitch for yourself, and I've never been good at selling. Camila says I undersell. My manager Fernando says I need to "make my impact more visible." Everyone has advice.

The thing is, I know what I've done. Seventeen production releases this year. Zero rollbacks. Mentored two junior engineers who both got promoted. Reduced our CI pipeline time by forty percent. But writing it all out in first person with action verbs and metrics feels like performing. "I spearheaded." "I drove." Those aren't words real people use.

My colleague Ana has the opposite problem—she writes these self-assessments that read like award acceptance speeches. And it works for her. She got promoted last year. I've been at the same level for four years. So maybe the system rewards the performance, not the work.

I'll write the self-assessment this weekend. I'll use the strong verbs. I'll quantify everything. It just feels like wearing a costume that doesn't fit. My papá was a carpenter in Medellín. He didn't have to write paragraphs about how well he built a cabinet. The cabinet spoke for itself.

**Nudge:** "You say the cabinet speaks for itself—but does it?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-26

Second time writing today, which I never do. But I sat down to draft the self-assessment after dinner and something shifted.

Started listing my projects and realized I've been carrying more than I thought. The payment gateway wasn't just a migration—it was six months of reverse-engineering undocumented legacy code while keeping the live system running. The mentoring wasn't casual either. I had weekly one-on-ones with Daniela and Esteban, reviewed their PRs line by line, talked them through architectural decisions. That's not a line item. That's shaping how two engineers think.

Maybe the problem isn't that I can't write about my work. Maybe it's that where I grew up, talking about yourself like that was considered feo—ugly, tasteless. You let your elders praise you. You didn't praise yourself. My mother would have given me a look if I'd walked around listing my accomplishments.

But I'm not in Medellín anymore. And the rules here are different. Not better or worse, just different. Fernando isn't going to guess what I've done. He has thirty direct reports. If I don't tell him, he genuinely won't know.

I wrote four paragraphs. Strong verbs and all. Read it back and it sounded like someone else, but maybe that's okay. Maybe learning a new professional language isn't the same as losing the old one.

Fernando scheduled a "career path conversation" for Monday. I don't know what that means. Could be good—could be the director track opening up. Could also be them telling me to lateral into some platform team nobody wants to join. I've seen both versions. People keep saying I should be hopeful but I don't want to get set up for another no.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-02

Had the meeting with Fernando. It was... better than expected. He said the director position is opening again in Q2, and this time he's putting me forward as the internal candidate. Not a guarantee, but a real recommendation. He said my self-assessment was "the strongest you've written" and that the team's reliability metrics speak for themselves.

I thanked him. Shook his hand. Walked back to my desk and just sat there for a while.

The strange part is I expected to feel more. Elated, relieved, something big. Instead it was quiet. Like I'd been holding my breath for a long time and finally let it out, but the exhale was so slow I barely noticed. Maybe that's what it feels like when something you've wanted actually moves closer—not fireworks, just a slight loosening in the chest.

Camila was happy when I told her. She said "finally they're seeing what I've always seen." I almost corrected her—they're not seeing me, they're seeing a version of me that learned to write in their language. But I didn't say that because it would've turned a good moment into a philosophy seminar. And she deserved to just be happy for me.

Took the girls out for helado to celebrate. Lucía got three scoops. Sometimes that's enough.

**Nudge:** "The version they're seeing—is that still you?"

**Response:** I've been thinking about that since I wrote it. And honestly... yes. I think it is. It's not the whole me. It's not the me who eats tamales on the balcony or argues about fútbol with my brother-in-law. But it's not fake either. It's the part of me that learned to operate in a system that wasn't built for people like me. A Colombian who came here with an accent and a degree nobody recognized at first.

Maybe I resented it for a long time because it felt like the system was asking me to become someone else. But writing that self-assessment—I wasn't lying. I was translating. And translation isn't betrayal. My papá spoke three regional dialects. He didn't lose himself switching between them.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-05

Submitted my director application packet today. Fernando reviewed it yesterday and said it was solid. Included the self-assessment, three peer endorsements, and a one-page proposal for how I'd restructure the backend org.

The proposal was the hardest part. I had to suggest changes to the current structure, which means implicitly criticizing how things are done now. I kept it diplomatic—framed everything as "building on existing strengths" rather than pointing out problems. Ana said I should be bolder. Maybe she's right. But I know who's on the review panel, and bold doesn't play well with everyone.

Coached volleyball practice after work. The girls are getting better at their rotations. They're learning to trust the system—each person covers their zone, and the whole court gets covered. There's a lesson there that I keep noticing but I'm not going to spell it out.

**Nudge:** "You keep it diplomatic—what are you protecting?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-12

Interview panel was today. Four people, ninety minutes. I said what I prepared. Didn't improvise, didn't overshoot. Answered the hard question about team conflict honestly—told them I default to listening first. They nodded. Whether that's enough, I'll know in two weeks. Going to bed early. Camila left soup on the stove.
