# Persona 58d843b6: Tariq Al-Mansouri

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 58d843b6
- **Name:** Tariq Al-Mansouri
- **Age:** 45-54
- **Profession:** Entrepreneur
- **Culture:** Middle Eastern
- **Core Values:** Tradition
- **Bio:** Tariq runs a mid-sized olive oil export company in Amman that his father founded in 1978, inheriting the business after his father's stroke eight years ago. He is raising three children with his wife Rania, insisting they attend Friday prayers together and spend every Eid at his mother's house in Irbid despite the long drive. His eldest daughter recently announced she wants to study film in London rather than join the company, and the disagreement has created a quiet rift at home. He wakes at 4:30 most mornings to handle European buyer calls, and the strain of keeping the business competitive against industrial producers while maintaining the artisanal methods his father insisted on is wearing him thin.

Told Nadia she could take the summer to think about London but that we would discuss it seriously in June. She looked relieved but I felt nothing. I keep wondering if I am just delaying because I do not know how to say no to her face.

**Nudge:** "What would saying no actually cost you?"

**Response:** More than the argument itself. I think it would mean admitting the business is not enough to hold the family together the way it held us when Baba was running it.

My cousin Faisal called to say his son is taking over his construction firm this year. He did not say it to make a point, but it landed like one. His kid is twenty-three and already stepping in. Meanwhile I cannot even get Nadia to visit the warehouse.

People keep acting like I should just let her go do whatever she wants. Rania says I am being stubborn. But nobody asks what happens to this company in fifteen years. Nobody asks who carries it forward. I did not choose this either, but I showed up.

**Nudge:** "Did you want someone to ask you that back then?"

**Response:** That was a different time. There was no question to ask.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-06

The new Italian distributor wants us to rebrand. Sleeker labels, English-only packaging, drop the family crest. He said the current look feels "regional." I almost hung up on him. Regional. My father designed that label with a calligrapher from Salt in 1982. It has been on every bottle we have ever shipped.

I brought it up with Samir, my operations manager, and he shrugged and said maybe the Italian has a point. That the European market responds to minimalism. I asked him if he would strip his grandmother's embroidery off the wall because a decorator said it clashed with the furniture. He laughed. I was not joking.

Rania told me later I am letting sentiment run the business. Maybe. But if I strip away everything that connects this company to where it came from, what exactly am I running? A logistics operation with my name on it. That is not what Baba built and it is not what I agreed to carry.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-07

Could not sleep last night. Kept turning over the rebranding conversation. Went down to the kitchen at two in the morning and found Baba's old notebooks in the drawer where Mama keeps the good tablecloths. He used to write down every buyer's name, where they were from, what they ordered. Pages of it in his careful handwriting.

I sat there reading for an hour. He wrote about a French buyer in 1991 who wanted to change the oil blend and he refused. Lost the account. Got it back three years later when the buyer admitted the original was better. I do not know if that story is supposed to comfort me or scare me. The market is different now.

The thing that unsettles me is not the Italian distributor. It is that part of me can see his point. The rational part. And I do not know what it means that I can see it and still feel like acting on it would be a kind of betrayal. Like I would be the one who finally broke the thread.

**Nudge:** "What does that thread hold together for you?"

**Response:** Everything. The way we do business, yes, but also who I am in relation to my father. If I change the way he built things, I am saying his way was not good enough. And I am not ready to say that, even if the numbers eventually force me to.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-10

Nadia brought home a prospectus from the London film school. Left it on the kitchen table like it was a magazine. Rania pretended not to notice. I noticed.

She has been building her case quietly. Showing us short films she made on her phone, mentioning alumni who work at Al Jazeera and BBC Arabic. She is smart about it. She knows a direct argument will not work with me so she is laying evidence like a lawyer. I would admire it if it were not aimed at dismantling the one plan I had for this family's future.

My brother Kamal called and said I should let her go, that holding her back will only push her further away. Easy for him to say. He moved to Dubai fifteen years ago and calls on holidays. He has no idea what it takes to keep things together here. To sit at Mama's table every Friday and hold the center while everyone else drifts toward their own orbits. Someone has to be the anchor and apparently that someone is always me.

**Nudge:** "Is being the anchor something you chose or something that happened to you?"

**Response:** Both, I think. It happened because I was the eldest and stayed. But I also chose it every single time I could have left. The problem is I chose it so many times it stopped feeling like a choice and started feeling like who I am. I do not know how to separate the two anymore.

Long week. Two shipments delayed because of port congestion in Aqaba, had to personally call four buyers to explain. Spent most of Thursday driving to Irbid because Mama's water heater broke and my brother the Dubai expert could not exactly fix it from there.

Came home to Rania and the kids eating mansaf without me. They saved me a plate. Ate it cold at ten o'clock watching the news. Just one of those weeks where everything takes twice as long and nothing feels finished.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-14

Actually, the mansaf was good even cold. Rania uses Mama's recipe, the one with the dried yogurt from the women's co-op in Ajloun. Small thing but it reminded me that some things do carry forward without anyone forcing them.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-19

Quarterly numbers came in and they are flat. Not terrible, but flat in a market that is growing means we are losing ground. Samir put together a presentation about expanding into the Gulf retail market. New packaging, smaller bottles, gift sets for Ramadan. I told him to go ahead with the proposal.

I did not fight it this time. Maybe because I am tired, maybe because the port delays last week reminded me how fragile our European pipeline really is. Diversifying makes sense. I told myself the Gulf packaging can look different from the European line without touching the original label. A compromise. Baba would have called it something else.

Nadia asked me at dinner if she could shadow a documentary crew in Amman next week. Some university project. I said fine without really thinking about it. Rania gave me a look, like she was surprised I did not put up a fight. I did not have one in me tonight.

**Nudge:** "Are these concessions or decisions?"

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-20

Took the kids to Friday prayers at the old mosque near Jabal Amman instead of our usual one. The imam there knew my father. Afterward he told my youngest, Omar, a story about how Baba once donated an entire shipment to a refugee camp in the eighties. Omar's eyes went wide. He had never heard that one.

Drove home with all three kids in the back seat arguing about whether Jiddo was a hero or just generous. Nadia said both. I did not correct anyone. It was a good morning.

**Nudge:** "What would you have corrected?"

**Response:** That he was not being generous. He was being obligated. In our family, in our community, you give because that is what you do. It is not heroism, it is just the way things work. But watching Omar hear it as something extraordinary made me realize maybe that way of doing things is not as obvious to them as it was to us. And that worries me.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-26

Nadia came back from the documentary shoot glowing. She talked through dinner about camera angles and interview techniques. I listened and felt two things at once: pride and something heavier I cannot name.

## Entry 10 - 2025-06-27

The Italian distributor sent a revised proposal. They will keep the family crest but want to modernize the typography and add English and Italian text below the Arabic. Samir thinks it is a fair middle ground. I stared at the mockup for twenty minutes.

It looks fine. Objectively, it looks fine. The crest is there, the Arabic is there, just smaller. And I keep telling myself that Baba adapted too, that the company looked different in 1995 than it did in 1978. But he was the one making those changes. He earned the right to decide what stayed and what evolved. I inherited the decision and it does not sit the same way.

Rania asked me tonight if I have thought more about Nadia and London. I told her not now. She said there will never be a right time and she is probably correct. The June deadline I set is almost here and I do not have an answer. I do not even have a framework for the answer. Just this weight in my chest every time I think about the company ten years from now with no family in it.

**Nudge:** "What if the company survives but looks nothing like what your father built?"

## Entry 11 - 2025-07-02

Told Nadia she can apply to London. She cried. I cried. Rania stood in the doorway pretending she was not crying. The house felt lighter after, like we had been holding our breath for weeks.

**Nudge:** "What changed between last week and now?"

**Response:** Nothing changed, really. I just stopped waiting for the feeling to go away and made the decision with it still there. Maybe that is what my father did too. Carried the weight and moved anyway.
