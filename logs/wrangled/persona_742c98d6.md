## Entry 0 - 2025-09-07

Had a terrible shift today and I can't stop going over it. We had a team meeting about the new triage protocols and someone — one of the younger consultants — made a comment about how we should be "more selective" about which patients get palliative referrals because the ward is overstretched. He was basically implying we should deprioritise patients who don't have family pushing for it, which in practice means the homeless patients, the migrants, the people nobody's advocating for. I sat there and I knew exactly what he meant and I said nothing. A few people nodded. Anke looked uncomfortable but she didn't speak up either.

I've been doing this work for thirty years and I just let it slide. I told myself it was because the meeting was already running long and tempers were short, but honestly I think I was just tired. Tired and afraid of being that older nurse who's always making everything political. But those are real people he was talking about, people I've held hands with while they died. Nobody should have to earn the right to a dignified death by having relatives who make enough noise.

I'm angry at myself. I keep rehearsing what I should have said and it's making my stomach hurt. Willem would tell me to let it go and pick my battles, but this feels like exactly the kind of battle I should have picked.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you in that moment?"

**Response:** I think I was just exhausted and didn't want to be the difficult one again.

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-11

Spent the afternoon at the refugee clinic. There was a Syrian woman, maybe my age, who came in with chronic back pain that's been ignored for months because she keeps getting shuffled between GP practices and nobody follows through. I got her a proper referral to the physiotherapist and explained everything in simple Dutch, and her daughter translated the rest. When she left she squeezed my hand and said something in Arabic I didn't understand but I could tell what it meant.

Those moments remind me why I do what I do. It's not heroic, it's just basic decency — making sure someone gets the care they should have had weeks ago. The system fails these people constantly and most of the time there's nobody there to catch them. I can't fix everything but I can make sure the ones who come through my door don't fall through the cracks.

Walked home along the Maas afterwards and the late afternoon light on the water was beautiful. Felt like myself for the first time all week. Made a simple stamppot for dinner and sat in the garden with a glass of wine and the radio on. Days like this keep me going.

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-13

Saturday. Slept in which I almost never do. Made coffee and read the Volkskrant at the kitchen table like I used to when the kids were small, except now the house is quiet and nobody's fighting over the last beschuit.

The paper had a big piece about plastic pollution in the North Sea and it got me going again. They found microplastics in fish at the market in Scheveningen. I remember swimming there as a girl and the water was already dirty then, but at least we weren't eating the pollution. Now it's in everything. I want to feel like individual choices matter — I bring my own bags, I cycle, I sort my recycling obsessively — but these articles make it feel so small against the scale of it. Shell is right there across the river and they're still doing what they've always done.

Went grocery shopping after, argued with myself about buying the organic tomatoes that cost twice as much. Bought them anyway. Had a quiet afternoon fixing the hem on my uniform trousers and listening to a podcast about healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa. Normal day really. Nothing remarkable.

**Nudge:** "Does that smallness ever make you want to stop trying?"

**Response:** No. It just makes me angrier at the ones who could actually change things and choose not to.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-19

Long week. Thursday and Friday were double shifts because Pieter called in sick and nobody else could cover. By Friday afternoon I was running on automatic. One of my patients, an elderly man with no family contact, was scheduled for a comfort care review. I should have sat with him properly, gone through everything, made sure he understood all the options. Instead I rushed through it in ten minutes because I had three other patients waiting and the ward was short-staffed.

He deserved better than that. Every patient deserves a proper conversation about their care, especially when there's nobody else asking questions on their behalf. But I chose efficiency because I was stretched thin and it was the easier option. Ticked the box, moved on, felt wrong about it immediately.

The system is designed this way — there are never enough people, never enough time, and eventually everyone starts cutting corners. The corners you cut are always on the patients who won't complain. I know this. I've given talks about this. And I still did it. The gap between what I know is right and what I actually do when I'm exhausted is wider than I'd like to admit.

**Nudge:** "Would you have rushed if he'd had family there watching?"

**Response:** Probably not. And that's the worst part.

Colleague made a joke about the refugee patients "costing us all money" at lunch and everyone laughed. I didn't laugh but I didn't say anything either. I'm not their teacher.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-29

Been thinking about this all weekend and I need to write it down. Last Tuesday the ward got offered a bulk supply deal on disposable gloves and gowns from a company I know uses factories with terrible labour conditions in Southeast Asia. I've read the reports, I've seen the articles. The alternative supplier is more expensive and our budget is already squeezed. I signed off on the cheaper option because the ward manager was pushing hard and I didn't want to hold up the order for something nobody else seemed to care about.

It's such a small thing in the grand scheme. Nobody dies because of which glove supplier we use. But it's the principle — I spend my weekends at the refugee clinic working with people who've fled exactly these kinds of conditions, and then on a Tuesday morning I quietly approve the purchase order that keeps those conditions going. The hypocrisy of it sits badly.

I keep telling myself I'm one person and I can't fight every fight. But I also know that's what everyone tells themselves and it's how nothing ever changes. Willem says I take too much on and that it's not my job to fix global supply chains. He's probably right practically but it doesn't make me feel less complicit.

**Nudge:** "What would it have cost you to push back on Tuesday?"

**Response:** Probably just an awkward meeting. That's what bothers me.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-29

Can't sleep so I'm writing more. Still stuck on the glove thing from earlier but it's connecting to something bigger now. At the ethics panel meeting last month, there was a discussion about end-of-life care guidelines for undocumented patients. The hospital legal team sent someone who basically said we should follow the strict protocol, which in practice means reduced access for people without valid papers. I pushed back in the meeting — I did speak up that time — but when the vote came I abstained because I didn't want to be the only dissenting voice on record. The motion passed.

I told myself abstaining was a form of protest, that it showed I didn't agree. But really I just didn't want my name attached to a losing vote. That's cowardice dressed up as strategy. These are people's lives and I was protecting my position on the panel.

The pattern is clear when I write it all out like this. I care deeply and I act cautiously and there's a gap between the two that keeps growing. I'm fifty-eight years old and I've built a reputation as someone who cares about these things, but when it costs me something — even something small like an awkward moment or a dissenting vote — I back down. I don't know what to do with that.

**Nudge:** "When was the last time you didn't back down?"

Quiet Sunday. Cycled to the market, bought too much cheese, came home and pottered around the garden pulling weeds. Nothing on my mind for once.

## Entry 8 - 2025-10-07

Today I drove to work instead of cycling because it was raining hard and I was running late. Sat in traffic on the A20 for forty minutes, engine running, watching the Shell refinery chimneys pump out whatever it is they pump out, and I thought about what a fraud I am. I have a sign on my fridge that says "There is no Planet B" and there I was sitting in a diesel car because I didn't want to get wet.

It's not just the driving. I had a coffee from the machine downstairs in a disposable cup because I forgot my thermos. I ordered something from Amazon last week because it was cheaper and I needed it quickly when I could have waited and bought it from the local shop. Each thing on its own is nothing. But they add up and I'm adding them up and I don't like the total.

I talk to my daughter Lotte about these things and she says I'm too hard on myself, that systemic problems need systemic solutions and individual guilt is a distraction. She's probably right intellectually. But I grew up in a generation that was told every action matters, that you vote with your wallet, that if everyone just did their bit. And now I'm not even doing my bit consistently. The convenience keeps winning and I keep noticing and it's exhausting.

**Nudge:** "Is the guilt actually changing anything?"

**Response:** Honestly no. It just makes me tired.

## Entry 9 - 2025-10-08

Staff meeting today. The new director gave a presentation about "efficiency metrics" and patient throughput targets. During the Q&A, one of the junior nurses — Fatima, she's been here about eight months — asked a very good question about whether these targets would mean less time per patient for the non-Dutch-speaking patients who need interpreters. The director gave a non-answer about "equitable resource allocation" and moved on.

After the meeting, Fatima looked deflated. She came to me in the hallway and said she felt like nobody supported her question. I told her it was a good question and I agreed with her concern. She asked why I hadn't said anything during the meeting. I said something about it being a big room and timing not being right. She just nodded and walked off.

I've been that young nurse asking the hard question in a room full of people who agree privately and stay silent publicly. I know exactly how that feels and I let it happen to someone else. She needed one senior person to back her up and I didn't do it. The timing excuse is nonsense. I just didn't want to be seen challenging the new director in his first week. Politics over principle again. I should have backed her up.

**Nudge:** "Are you going to talk to Fatima?"

**Response:** I think I have to. Not just for her. I need to know I'm still capable of following through.

## Entry 10 - 2025-10-14

Brought Fatima a coffee this morning and told her I'd raise her question at the next ethics panel. She smiled. Small thing but it felt right.
