# Persona 15f8d4b9: Farid Al-Rashid

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 15f8d4b9
- **Name:** Farid Al-Rashid
- **Age:** 55+
- **Profession:** Gig Worker
- **Culture:** Middle Eastern
- **Core Values:** Tradition
- **Bio:** Farid is a 58-year-old rideshare driver in Dearborn, Michigan, who spent thirty years as an accountant in Amman before emigrating to join his adult children. He drives nights and weekends to supplement his daughter's household income, refusing to be "just a guest in his own family's home." He keeps a worn prayer rug behind the driver's seat and times his breaks around salat. His passengers sometimes mistake his silence for unfriendliness, but he is simply counting the days until his grandson's aqiqah ceremony, which he is quietly funding from his earnings without telling anyone.

## Entry 0 - 2025-08-11

Eleven hours behind the wheel today. My knees ache in a way that reminds me I am not the young man who once walked to the mosque before dawn without thinking twice. But the tips were good, and I have now saved enough for the lamb. Hassan does not know — he would insist on paying himself, and that is precisely why I cannot tell him.

My father slaughtered the lamb for my aqiqah with his own hands. I watched him do the same for my sons. Here in Michigan there is a halal butcher who will prepare everything properly. Different hands, same intention. I tell myself this is enough. Some nights I believe it.

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-18

Picked up a young couple from the airport. They asked if I minded them eating in the car. I said no. They left crumbs everywhere. I vacuumed at the gas station before my next ride. This is the job.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-25

Layla asked me today why I still drive when my back gives me trouble. She said it gently, the way she says everything, but I heard what she meant: why don't you rest? Why don't you let Hassan take care of things?

I did not know how to explain that resting is not rest for me. My father worked until the week before he died. His father the same. A man provides. A man contributes. I know Layla was raised here and thinks differently about these things, and I love her for making space in her home for me, but I cannot sit in that house eating food I did not earn while my grandchildren grow up thinking their grandfather is just an old man who watches television.

She meant well. I know this. But I could not look at her when I answered, because if I had, she would have seen too much. I said something about needing the exercise, about enjoying the passengers. Lies dressed up as half-truths. The real answer lives in my chest where I cannot reach it with words.

Tonight I drove until midnight. Every fare felt like proof that I am still useful.

**Nudge:** "You want them to see you're useful, but you're hiding the proof."

**Response:** Because if I show them the money, they will say I am too old to earn it. The secret is the only way the work stays mine.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-26

Same-day entry, different weight. Woke up and my first thought was about the conversation yesterday. Then Fajr, then coffee, then Hassan asked if I wanted to come to his office for lunch because they are having some kind of celebration for a coworker. I said yes because he rarely asks.

His office is all glass and computers and young people in clothes I do not understand. They were kind to me. Someone asked what I did before driving and I said accounting and they seemed surprised, then interested. One young woman asked about Jordan and I talked about Amman in a way I had not talked about it in months. She listened.

On the drive home Hassan said "You should come more often, Baba." I am still thinking about why that made my eyes sting.

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-05

Three rides cancelled after they saw my name. Fourth passenger asked where I was "really" from. I answered. He said nothing for the rest of the trip. No tip. I am too tired to feel anything about this tonight. Tomorrow I will feel it.

**Nudge:** "Is the tiredness about the hours, or about something else?"

**Response:** Both. Always both. Not something I have words for right now.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-08

My brother called from Amman to say I should come back. "What are you doing there, driving strangers around? You had a career. You had respect." He does not understand that respect here is different, that I am building something he cannot see from where he sits.

He thinks I left everything behind. He does not know that I brought everything with me — the prayers, the food, the way I greet the older men at the mosque. I did not abandon our customs. I carry them. The car is just a car. What I do between the rides, who I am when no one is watching, that is what matters.

I told him I was happy. He did not believe me. That is his problem, not mine.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-15

The aqiqah was yesterday. I did not write then because I wanted to hold the day without examining it.

The lamb was perfect. The butcher did everything correctly and I stood with Hassan as we distributed the meat — a third to the family, a third to friends, a third to those in need. My grandson slept through most of it, which is as it should be. He will not remember this day. But I will remember his face, and Layla holding him, and the way Hassan looked at me when he realized I had paid for everything.

He tried to argue. I said: "This is my right as his grandfather. You will have your turn when your son has a son." He went quiet. Later, when the guests had left, he came to me in the kitchen and said only "Shukran, Baba." Thank you. Nothing more. It was enough.

My father would have been proud. Not of me — he did not give praise easily — but of the continuation. That we are still here, still doing what was done for us, still passing it forward. The country changed. The language around us changed. But the lamb was shared according to the old ways. That matters. That is the thread I refuse to let break.

**Nudge:** "What else feels like that kind of thread for you?"

**Response:** Friday prayers. The recipes my mother taught Layla. Teaching my grandson the Arabic words for grandfather and bread and home before he learns them in English. Small things. But small things are how the rope stays woven.

## Entry 7 - 2025-09-15

Second entry today. Drove three hours after the evening prayers. Quiet roads. One passenger, an older woman going to the hospital to visit her husband. We did not speak much but she thanked me twice when I helped her with the door. Some shifts feel like service. Tonight was one.
