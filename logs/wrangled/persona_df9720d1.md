- **Name:** Kevin Yeung
- **Age:** 18-24

- **Bio:** Kevin is a 22-year-old running a small streetwear resale business out of his parents' apartment in Hong Kong. He dropped out of university after one year to pursue the venture, a decision his family still brings up at every dinner. He craves new projects and the rush of closing deals but defaults to keeping the peace at home, often biting back opinions to avoid confrontation with his parents and older relatives. His social circle is split between childhood friends who followed conventional paths and newer friends from the reselling community who share his appetite for risk.

## Entry 0 - 2025-02-26

Had a small win today. Closed a bulk deal with a buyer in Shenzhen, margins were solid, the whole thing came together in like two hours from first DM to payment confirmed. These are the moments where I feel like I actually know what I'm doing. Not pretending, not faking it. Just reading the situation right and moving.

My mum asked about it at dinner and I gave her the short version. She nodded but didn't say much. A year ago that would've stung. Tonight it just felt fine. I don't need her to get it. The deal speaks for itself and I know what it took.

**Nudge:** "What's different about tonight?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-01

Spent the afternoon sourcing new drops, scrolling through pages of the same stuff everyone else is flipping. Getting harder to find edges. Might need to branch into vintage or accessories, something less saturated. Called James about it and he's keen to explore Taipei suppliers. Brain's moving fast today, not in a bad way, just restless.

**Nudge:** "Bored or scared of stalling?"

**Response:** Neither really. Just how my brain works, always scanning for the next angle. Anyway I need to finalize the Taipei logistics before I spiral into planning mode.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-06

Auntie May came for dinner. The usual questions: when am I going back to school, do I have a real plan, what happens when this "internet thing" stops working. I smiled and gave polite non-answers. Changed the subject to her son's new job because I knew that would keep her busy for twenty minutes.

It's a skill at this point, steering conversations away from anything that makes them uncomfortable about me. I don't even get annoyed anymore. It's just the cost of sitting at that table without ruining everyone's evening. My cousin Jason does the same thing with his music career. We exchanged a look across the table. That was enough.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-09

Dad asked me this morning if I'd consider taking a part-time role at Uncle Raymond's logistics company. Stable income, benefits, "good for your resume." I said I'd think about it. He looked relieved, which is probably the part that's bothering me most.

The business is actually growing. March numbers are tracking 40% above February. I have a potential partnership with a streetwear brand in Seoul that could change the whole trajectory. But none of that registers with him because it doesn't look like a job. I didn't bring up the Seoul thing. No point until there's a signed contract he can hold in his hands.

**Nudge:** "Are you thinking about it or just buying time?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-09

Been sitting with the uncle's company thing all day. Part of me knows the smart move is to say no and keep building. The numbers back me up. But there's this other part, the part that watched my dad's face relax when I said I'd consider it, and that part wants to just take the damn job so everyone can stop worrying.

It's not even about the money or the role. It's about what saying no does to the room. Every holiday, every family dinner, I'm the loose thread. The one who doesn't fit the pattern. And I can handle that most days but sometimes I wonder if I'm burning through goodwill I'm going to need later. Like what happens when I actually need their support for something and they've already written me off as the kid who wouldn't listen.

The Seoul partnership could be real. If it lands, it validates everything. But if it doesn't, I'm just the dropout who turned down a stable offer to chase another long shot. I keep toggling between these two versions of how this plays out and neither one lets me sleep.

**Nudge:** "What support are you actually afraid of losing?"

**Response:** Honestly, probably not financial. They'd help if things went really bad regardless. It's more like... being taken seriously. Right now I'm tolerated. If I keep going against what they want and it doesn't pay off spectacularly, I become the cautionary tale they tell my younger cousins. That's the version I can't stomach.

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-09

Mum just came into my room to say dad's feelings were hurt that I haven't given an answer about uncle's company yet. It's been twelve hours. Twelve. I told her I was still thinking and she gave me the look, the one that means she's already decided what the right answer is and is waiting for me to arrive at it.

I'm not being ungrateful. I know they're looking out for me. But every time they frame some fallback option as "just in case," what they're really saying is they don't think this works. And maybe they're right, but I need to figure that out on my own terms, not because I got guilted into hedging. Anyway. I told her I'd talk to dad tomorrow. That bought me another day at least.
