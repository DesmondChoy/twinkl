## Entry 0 - 2025-01-07

Back from the Mekong research trip with my students. Three weeks of river sampling, village visits, and improvised lessons under thatched roofs. My body is wrecked—mosquito bites on my ankles, a persistent cough from the humidity, and I think I pulled something in my shoulder carrying equipment. But here's the thing: I feel more awake than I have in months.

The kids were incredible. There was this moment when we were testing water quality near a fishing village, and one student started asking the local fishermen about changes they'd noticed over the years. No prompting from me. She just did it. That kind of spontaneous curiosity—you can't manufacture that in a classroom with fluorescent lights and standardized tests.

Now I'm back at my desk, and already I can feel the walls closing in. Tomorrow's faculty meeting will be about exam preparation timelines and classroom decoration guidelines. I know I should be grateful for the stability of this position, but part of me is already googling "environmental education programs hiring abroad."

I need to sleep for about a week. But I also know that if I stay still too long, this feeling of being alive will fade, and I'll be left with the same restlessness I've been running from since I was thirty.

**Nudge:** "What happened at thirty?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-10

Faculty meeting was worse than expected. Three hours on compliance paperwork. Considered walking out twice.

**Nudge:** "What almost made you walk?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-13

Got coffee with an old colleague who left teaching to do documentary work—she's filming a piece on coral restoration in Indonesia, asked if I'd be interested in consulting. Said I'd think about it but we both knew that meant yes.

**Nudge:** "So why say you'd think about it?"

**Response:** Habit, I guess. I've learned not to show my cards too quickly. People get concerned when you seem too eager to drop everything. My mother used to call it "chasing the wind"—not a compliment. So I've gotten good at pretending to deliberate while my mind is already packing bags.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-19

The coral project is moving forward. My colleague Mei-Hua sent over preliminary details: two months in Sulawesi, starting in March, helping design educational components for local schools. The pay is modest but includes accommodation and meals. My current contract here allows for unpaid leave if approved by the department head.

I spent most of Sunday creating a detailed proposal for why this should be considered professional development rather than abandonment. Listed educational outcomes, skill acquisition, potential for future curriculum integration. The proposal is twelve pages long. I know Principal Huang will see through it—he's commented before that I seem to have "one foot out the door"—but I need the formality to protect my position in case I want to come back.

The strangest part: I'm not even sure I do want to come back. But I keep building these safety nets anyway. Maybe it's the years of my father telling me that a respectable career means staying in one place, building a reputation, becoming someone people can count on. Every time I leave, I hear his voice asking when I'll finally settle down.

Submitted the proposal this afternoon. Now I wait.

**Nudge:** "What would it take to not build the net?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe if I had enough money that coming back wasn't a financial necessity. Or maybe if I stopped caring about what my family thinks. But I'm 48 years old and I still want my father's approval, even though he's been dead for six years. That's probably the most honest thing I've written in months.

## Entry 4 - 2025-01-23

Principal Huang approved the leave request—but with conditions. I have to document everything, submit weekly reports on "educational outcomes observed," and return with a "concrete implementation plan for classroom integration." Basically turning an expedition into a bureaucratic exercise.

And yet I said yes immediately because two months in Indonesia is two months not here, not in this building with its humming fluorescent lights and scheduled bathroom breaks for students and the same conversations about test scores over and over—

My colleague Li-Na said she envied me at lunch today. Said she wished she could just pick up and go like I do. I wanted to tell her it's not freedom, it's compulsion. I don't choose to leave; I have to leave, or something in me starts to suffocate. But that sounds dramatic and she has two kids in elementary school and a mother-in-law with dementia, so I just smiled and said "you should try it sometime" which felt like a lie and a truth at the same time.

The approval notice is pinned to my corkboard. March feels like forever away. I'm already looking at flights, making lists, thinking about what equipment I'll need. The anticipation is almost as good as the going. Almost.

**Nudge:** "You said compulsion, not choice. What's the difference for you?"

**Response:** Choice implies I could stay if I wanted to. That staying is a real option I'm evaluating. But when I'm honest with myself, staying was never on the table. The only question was whether I'd leave with permission or without it. Compulsion is when the leaving isn't optional—it's just a matter of how much I'll sacrifice to do it.

## Entry 5 - 2025-01-24

My sister called to say I'm being selfish again. That our mother is getting older and needs family nearby. That I "can't keep running away from real life."

**Nudge:** "What did you say back?"

**Response:** I hung up. But what I wanted to say was: this IS my real life. The running isn't away from something—it's toward something. The problem is I've never been able to explain what that something is, not even to myself. All I know is that when I'm moving, when I'm somewhere new, when I don't know what tomorrow looks like—that's when I feel like I exist. Staying in one place feels like slowly disappearing. But try explaining that to someone whose definition of a good life is stability and proximity to family.

## Entry 6 - 2025-01-25

Spent the morning at the travel clinic getting vaccinations for Indonesia. Typhoid, hepatitis boosters, antimalarials. The nurse asked if this was my first time traveling to the region and I laughed—it was rude but I couldn't help it. She looked at my vaccine record and said "oh, you're one of those."

One of those. I know what she meant. The perpetual travelers, the people who seem allergic to staying put. She probably sees us all the time in a travel clinic. I wanted to ask her what else she's noticed about "people like me" but that seemed like a conversation neither of us wanted to have.

Afterward I walked through the night market near my apartment, the one I've been to a hundred times. Normally it bores me—same vendors, same food, same crowds. But today I looked at it differently, knowing I'll be gone in six weeks. The elderly woman selling scallion pancakes. The teenagers playing games on their phones while manning their parents' stalls. The specific quality of the light through the plastic tarps.

I do this every time I'm about to leave: suddenly appreciate what I've been ignoring. Then I leave anyway.

## Entry 7 - 2025-01-29

Mei-Hua called with updates on the Indonesia project. The funding came through, the local partners are confirmed, and there's even been interest from a university in Singapore about documenting our work for a larger research initiative. This is everything I wanted.

So why do I feel this undertow of anxiety?

I've been sitting with this feeling all day, trying to name it. It's not fear of the unknown—the unknown is the part I crave. It's something else. Maybe it's that I've built my entire identity around chasing the next horizon, and I'm starting to wonder what happens when I stop. Not if, but when. Because at some point, the body slows down. The opportunities shrink. The world gets smaller whether you want it to or not.

My mother is 76 this year. My sister was right about one thing: she won't be here forever. And I've spent most of my adult life being somewhere else, chasing experiences I can't even fully remember now. I have photo albums from twenty countries, but I couldn't tell you the name of my neighbors.

I don't know if this is wisdom finally arriving or just fatigue dressed up as self-awareness. But for the first time in a long time, I'm not sure the leaving will fix what the staying breaks.

I'll go to Indonesia anyway. Of course I will. But I'm writing this down so I remember: there was a moment, in January 2025, when I wondered if there might be another way to feel alive.

**Nudge:** "What would that other way look like?"

**Response:** I genuinely don't know. That's the terrifying part. My whole life has been organized around movement—every decision, every relationship, every job has been filtered through "will this let me keep moving?" I've never seriously tried to find out what the alternative would feel like because it seemed like death. But maybe it's not death. Maybe it's a different kind of life that I've never given a fair chance. I just don't know how to start when standing still has always felt like drowning.
