The coordinadora pulled me aside after class and told me my reading circle format doesn't align with the ministry's new standardized framework. She wants me to switch to the workbook model by next week. I said I'd look into it but I'm not changing what's working.

**Nudge:** "What happens when next week comes and you haven't switched?"

People keep acting like I'm being difficult but I sat through two years of watching kids at the private school fill out comprehension worksheets with dead eyes. My students here actually talk about the books we read. They argue about characters. Last week Sofia, who barely spoke in September, stood up and defended her interpretation of the ending of the story to the whole class. That doesn't come from a workbook.

I talked to the coordinadora again today and told her straight up that I'd document my students' progress however she needs but I won't gut the program to fit a checkbox. She didn't love it. But she didn't say no either. My mom thinks I should just comply and keep my head down, which is rich coming from someone who argued with every teacher I ever had.

**Nudge:** "Your mom told you to comply. How did that land?"

**Response:** It stung more than it should have. She's the reason I push back on things in the first place.

Took Camilo through practice problems for the ICFES all Saturday morning. He's getting better at the reading comprehension sections, still shaky on the quantitative reasoning but that's not really my wheelhouse. I set him up with a YouTube channel that breaks it down step by step and told him to message me if he gets stuck. His mom, my tia Elena, called from Medellin to thank me, which was nice.

Went to abuela's in the afternoon. She'd made sancocho even though it was just the two of us, enough for ten people as usual. We watched a novela together and I fixed the latch on her back door that's been loose for months. She seems okay. A little quieter than normal maybe, but she always gets like that around the anniversary of abuelo's passing.

Long day. Parent meetings ran until six and then I stayed to reorganize the classroom library because nobody else was going to. Camilo called with a question about a practice test but I was too fried to be useful so I told him we'd go over it this weekend.

**Nudge:** "You couldn't help Camilo tonight. Does that bother you?"

**Response:** Yeah, a little. He doesn't ask unless he's actually stuck.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-13

Got an email from the district office about a new mandate requiring all language arts teachers to submit weekly lesson plans using their template. The template is basically a fill-in-the-blank thing with pre-set learning objectives and approved activities. I forwarded it to my colleague Patricia and she just shrugged and said she'd start using it. I get it, she has two kids and no energy to fight bureaucracy. But I can't just do that.

The thing is, I know how this looks. I know people see me as the one who always has to do things her own way, the difficult teacher, the one who won't just go along. And maybe there's some truth in it. But I've also seen what happens when you hand over every decision about your classroom to someone who's never met your students. The kids in Ciudad Bolivar don't need another generic worksheet. They need someone paying attention to what actually reaches them.

I'm going to keep using my own plans and submit the template version as a formality. I've done this before. It's more work but I'd rather do double the planning than teach something I don't believe in.

**Nudge:** "You said maybe there's truth in being the difficult one. What's that like?"

**Response:** Lonely sometimes. Patricia used to push back with me but she stopped. I don't blame her but I notice it.

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-13

Second time writing today because I can't stop thinking about something that happened after school. One of my students, Diego, waited around after everyone left and asked me if I could help him write a letter to his dad who's working in Chile. He said his mom doesn't have time and he doesn't know how to start. So we sat there for forty minutes and I helped him figure out what he wanted to say. He wanted to tell his dad about a soccer game he played in and about a dog that follows him home from school every day.

It was one of those moments where you remember why you're doing this. Not the curriculum fights or the template emails or the district mandates. Just a kid who needed someone to sit with him and say yeah, that's worth writing down, your dad would want to hear about the dog.

I keep thinking about how many kids like Diego just need someone to stop and listen for half an hour. And then I think about how stretched thin I already am and how I told Camilo I'd help him this weekend and I promised abuela I'd come by Sunday and I still haven't finished planning next week's classes because I was busy making the fake template version for the district. There's only so much of me to go around.

Spent the morning with Camilo going through the quantitative reasoning section. He's definitely improving. We worked through the problems he'd flagged and he got about seventy percent right on his own before I stepped in. Told him that's real progress and he actually smiled, which he doesn't do much these days since he's so stressed about the exam. His mom is counting on him getting into a public university because they can't afford private tuition, so the pressure is real.

After that I went to abuela's. She was in better spirits today. She'd been to the market and bought ingredients for arepas de choclo, so we made them together. She told me stories about when she and abuelo first came to Bogota from the campo and how they used to make arepas on a clay stove. I've heard the stories before but I don't mind. She seems to need to tell them.

On the bus home I sketched out a rough plan for next week's reading unit. I'm going to have the kids write letters, inspired by Diego. They'll pick someone they want to tell something to and we'll work on voice and structure through that. It fits the ministry objectives if you squint at it the right way, and it's actually something the kids will care about.

**Nudge:** "Diego's letter became a whole unit. Does that happen a lot?"

**Response:** More than I realize probably. The best ideas come from paying attention to what the kids actually need, not from a planning document.

Tia Elena called tonight and said Camilo bombed his practice test today, the one right after our session. She wasn't blaming me but it felt like it. I keep wondering if I'm actually helping him or just making myself feel useful.

**Nudge:** "Making yourself feel useful — what made you put it that way?"

**Response:** I don't know, I'm just tired. He'll be fine, he's smart enough.
