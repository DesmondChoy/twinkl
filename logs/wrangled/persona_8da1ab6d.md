## Entry 0 - 2025-06-23

Another Monday spent optimizing database queries for a billing system. The work pays well, certainly better than anything I could have imagined when I left the village. But today I walked past the construction site where migrant workers are building our new office tower, and I saw a child no older than ten carrying bricks. Her mother was mixing cement nearby.

I wanted to say something, to do something. Instead I walked to my air-conditioned desk and wrote code that helps rich hospitals bill patients more efficiently. The disconnect between my daily labor and what I believe matters is growing wider every year.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from saying something?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-24

Couldn't sleep last night. Kept seeing that girl's face. Called my mother in the morning and she reminded me that I too carried water from the well before school when I was her age.

**Nudge:** "What did her saying that bring up for you?"

**Response:** It made me feel ashamed in a different way. Like I've become so removed from where I came from that I've forgotten what survival looks like. My mother wasn't excusing the child labor, she was reminding me that I've had the privilege to forget.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-27

Sent the monthly transfer to the village school. Also enrolled for an online course on building accessible software for low-resource settings. Start next week.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-03

The course is fascinating. We are learning about designing for users with limited internet, older phones, and varying literacy levels. It reminded me of my grandmother who never learned to read but could recognize patterns in kolam designs that would challenge any algorithm I could write.

I mentioned the course to Raghav at work today. He laughed and asked why I was bothering with "social service" projects when I could be learning AI tools that would increase my market value. I didn't have a good answer in the moment, but walking home I realized: the question itself reveals different assumptions about what work is for.

For Raghav, work is a transaction, skills exchanged for money. For me, at this stage in life, it feels like there should be more. Not everyone has thirty years of experience building systems. Maybe that expertise could serve people who actually need it, not just corporations looking to squeeze more margins. But then again, my daughter's tuition fees come from those same corporate margins. The math doesn't always work out cleanly.

**Nudge:** "Has Raghav always seen things that way?"

**Response:** He's younger, maybe mid-thirties. Grew up in a different India than I did, one where software engineers are heroes and startups are the new temples. I don't blame him. When I was his age, I was chasing the same things. The difference is I've reached them now and I'm asking what comes after.

Lakshmi suggested I should consider early retirement and volunteer full-time with some NGO. Easy for her to say when she has her own pension secured. I know she means well, but she doesn't understand how much of my identity is tied to being a working professional.

Also, and I didn't say this to her, there's fear. What if I give up the corporate world and realize I'm not actually useful to anyone? At least here, however meaningless the work feels, I have metrics proving my value. Pull requests merged, systems delivered, performance reviews completed.

**Nudge:** "What would 'useful' look like outside of work metrics?"

**Response:** I don't know. That's the honest answer. I've been measured by numbers for so long that I can't imagine what value looks like without them. Maybe helping someone learn to code who couldn't afford classes? But how would I know if I was actually making a difference?

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-09

Sprint planning ran until 7 PM. We're building features no one asked for because some VP read an article about what competitors are doing. I sat there for four hours nodding along, contributing where required, while part of me was calculating how many village school teachers' salaries could be paid with the cost of this one unnecessary feature.

I know this kind of thinking isn't productive. You can't compare everything to some moral baseline or you'll go mad. But today I'm too tired to pretend the comparison doesn't exist in my head.

**Nudge:** "Why does that comparison keep coming back?"

**Response:** Because I remember what it felt like to have nothing and know that luck was the only difference between me and so many others. Every rupee spent on nonsense feels like stolen opportunity for someone who could have used it better. I know that's not how economics works, but the feeling doesn't care about economics.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-11

Video call with Priya tonight. She's doing well in Toronto, enjoying her research on climate modeling. She asked about my work and I found myself describing it with more cynicism than usual. She paused and then said something that stuck: "Appa, you taught me that every small action matters. Why don't you believe that for yourself?"

She's right, of course. I've always told her and her generation that individual choices ripple outward, that systemic change starts with personal conviction. But somewhere along the way I started feeling like my own choices were too small to matter against the scale of suffering I see.

The conversation reminded me of why I became an engineer in the first place. Growing up, technology represented possibility, a way out of predetermined fates. I wanted to build things that would make life better. When did I lose that thread? Or maybe I haven't lost it, I've just buried it under spreadsheets and sprint cycles.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to un-bury it?"

Same day, later. After the call I went for a walk and found myself outside the construction site again. This time the workers had finished for the night. Empty scaffolding and silence. Felt strangely peaceful.

Spoke with HR about reducing to four days a week. They said they would need to discuss with leadership but it might be possible with adjusted compensation. The money difference isn't trivial, but Lakshmi and I talked it through and we can manage.

The fifth day I want to dedicate to teaching coding at a community center in Koramangala that serves domestic workers and their children. I reached out to them last week and they welcomed the offer. First session scheduled for next Friday.

## Entry 9 - 2025-07-21

First teaching session did not go as planned. I had prepared carefully, slides on basic programming concepts, examples I thought would be relatable. But the students struggled with the mouse and keyboard basics I had taken for granted. One woman, Kamala, works as a housekeeper in my neighborhood. She spent fifteen minutes trying to type her name because she had never used a computer before.

I felt useless, like I had parachuted in with my fancy knowledge completely missing what they actually needed. By the end I had abandoned my lesson plan entirely and we spent the last hour just practicing how to open and close windows on the screen.

Walking home I felt deflated, then embarrassed for feeling deflated. Who did I think I was, expecting to transform lives in one session? This is going to be harder and slower than I imagined. The question is whether I have the patience and humility to stick with it.

**Nudge:** "What would patience look like here?"

**Response:** I don't know, showing up again next week I suppose. Starting where they are instead of where I expected them to be.

## Entry 10 - 2025-07-22

Kamala waved at me this morning. She was walking to work as I was leaving for office. She smiled and said, "Sir, I practiced. I can type my name now." Such a small thing, and yet.

Maybe this is what it looks like. Not grand gestures or systemic overhauls, but one person learning to type her own name for the first time at forty-five. My daughter was right. Every small action matters. The scale of the world's problems paralyzes me when I look at it whole, but zooming into this one interaction, this one victory, there's something real there. Something I helped create.

**Nudge:** "What changed between yesterday and today?"

**Response:** Nothing really changed. I just saw her smile and remembered why I wanted to do this in the first place.
