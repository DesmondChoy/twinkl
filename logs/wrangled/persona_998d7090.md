## Entry 0 - 2025-10-05

My sister Huda called again about the retirement fund thing. She has this way of bringing it up like she is just asking a casual question but we both know where it is going. "Just curious, do you have anything saved for when you cannot drive anymore?" She knows the answer. She has known for years.

What she does not understand is that I did the office thing for fifteen years and it nearly killed something in me. I am not going back to counting someone else's hours so I can sit in a flat at seventy with money and nothing to show for actually living. Maybe I am wrong. But right now the idea of giving up my mornings at Abu Khalil's cafe to stack dirham in an account I might never touch makes me feel worse than the uncertainty does.

**Nudge:** "What does the uncertainty actually feel like?"

**Response:** It feels like Tuesday. Anyway, Huda worries enough for both of us.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-12

Good week for rides. Had a couple of airport pickups that paid well and a half-day tour with a German family visiting Jerash. They wanted someone who could explain things properly, not just point at columns. Felt good using that part of my brain again. Have not done a proper tour in a while and I forgot how much I like it.

Spent the extra money on a proper dinner at Sufra with Tariq and Walid. Lamb mansaf, the real kind. We sat there for three hours talking about nothing important. Drove home with the windows down. Warm night still, even in October.

**Nudge:** "What made those three hours worth more than saving it?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-16

Long day, five rides back to back because I said yes to everything on the app. Knees ache and my shoulders are stiff. Going to bed early for once.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-16

Cannot sleep. Lying here thinking about that German family from last week, how the father kept asking me questions about Umayyad architecture like I was a professor. I knew every answer. Fifteen years driving tourists around will do that. Strange how that one afternoon made the whole week feel worthwhile.

**Nudge:** "Is it the knowing, or someone caring that you know?"

**Response:** Both, honestly. But if nobody asks, the knowing just sits there.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-17

Woke up still tired from yesterday's marathon. App is showing surge pricing downtown but my back says no. Skipped it. Felt relieved for ten minutes then started calculating what I am losing.

**Nudge:** "Which number matters more — what you lost or what your back saved you?"

**Response:** Ask me again when rent is due.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-17

Went out for coffee instead of driving. Sat at Abu Khalil's and watched the street for an hour. Sometimes that is the whole day and it has to be enough.

## Entry 6 - 2025-10-17

Third time writing today which is unusual for me. Tariq stopped by the cafe this afternoon and mentioned his son got him set up on one of those delivery apps, the bicycle ones. He is sixty-two and cycling around Amman in this heat delivering shawarma. He laughed about it but I could see he was embarrassed.

That could be me in a few years if the driving work dries up. Or it could not. Hard to know. Tariq still ordered the expensive coffee though, the Turkish one with cardamom they do properly. We split a knafeh. He said the delivery money is not bad and he picks his own hours. Same thing I always say about driving. Maybe we are both just telling ourselves the right story.

**Nudge:** "What would the wrong story sound like?"

**Response:** That we gave up something real for comfort that does not last. That choosing the nice afternoon over the stable job was not brave, it was just easier. I do not fully believe that. But I hear it in Huda's voice sometimes.

## Entry 7 - 2025-10-23

Had a fare today, a businessman from Riyadh who spent the whole ride talking on his phone about quarterly targets and staff problems. Tipped well but looked miserable. Suit that cost more than my rent and he did not once look out the window at the citadel lit up at night.

People assume I ended up here, like gig work is where you land when everything else falls through. Maybe for some. For me it was a door I walked through on purpose. I know what a Monday morning in an office smells like. I know what it costs. I chose this, and today, watching that man bark into his phone while Amman glowed outside his window, I felt sure about it.

**Nudge:** "Do you always feel this sure, or just on nights like this?"

**Response:** Not always. The sure feeling comes and goes. But tonight it is here so I am writing it down.

## Entry 8 - 2025-10-29

Rent went up. Landlord sent a message this morning, very polite about it, but two hundred dinars more starting January. I sat with the phone in my hand for a while doing the math. It is tight. It was already tight but now it is the kind of tight where one bad week matters.

Part of me wants to call Huda and tell her she was right, just get it over with. But right does not mean I know what to do differently. I cannot go back to an office. I do not mean I refuse, I mean something in me genuinely cannot. The last time I tried I lasted four months and stopped sleeping. So what is the alternative. Pick up more rides, skip the cafe, eat at home every night. Become the version of me that survives but does not particularly want to.

## Entry 9 - 2025-10-29

Later in the evening now. Calmed down a bit. Called Walid and he said his cousin has a spare room in Jabal Amman, smaller place but cheaper, and the neighborhood is actually nicer for walking. Might look at it this weekend. Moving is not ideal at fifty-eight but it is not the end of the world either.

I keep thinking about what I wrote earlier about not being able to go back to office work. That is true but it is also a wall I have built. The real question is whether the wall is protecting something important or just keeping me stuck. I think it is protecting something. The mornings where I sit with coffee and watch the light hit the old stones. The afternoons where I take the long route home because the view from the fourth circle is good at sunset. The dinners that go three hours because nobody has anywhere to be.

These are small things. Nobody would list them on a CV or count them as assets. But they are the thread running through every good day I have had in the past fifteen years. If I have to move to a smaller flat to keep them, that is an easy trade. If I have to drive more shifts, I can do that too. What I cannot do is give them up entirely and still recognize myself.

**Nudge:** "When did you first realize those small things were the thread?"

**Response:** Probably the week I quit the logistics job. I walked out at lunch and sat in a park eating falafel and thought, this is the first time in years I have actually tasted my food. That was fifteen years ago and I still remember the taste.
