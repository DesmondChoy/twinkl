## Entry 0 - 2025-01-30

Got asked to lead the new feature team at work and I keep thinking about it, like what does that even mean for the volunteer hours, the Tuesday class with the refugee program already conflicts with sprint planning sometimes and now this would be two nights a week minimum probably. Salary bump would be decent though and maybe I could donate more to the legal fund, that's something, but also just feels like I'd be trading actual time helping people for money to throw at the problem which isn't really the same thing when you think about it. Ana says I need to stop treating every decision like it's life or death but this one kind of matters doesn't it. The promotion could wait, there'll be other chances, except the team lead mentioned they're restructuring soon and who knows when the next opening would be.

**Nudge:** "Trading time for money to throw at problems - what does that change for you?"

**Response:** Just venting. Haven't decided anything yet.

Ana doesn't get why I can't just say yes to things that are good for us. It's not that simple.

**Nudge:** "What did Ana want you to say yes to?"

**Response:** The promotion. She thinks I'm making it harder than it needs to be, that we could actually save up for something if I took it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-04

Spent three hours Sunday at the climate march downtown and the whole time I'm checking my phone because the team needed me to look at a production bug, like I'm standing there with a sign about fossil fuels while my code is probably burning through AWS cycles unnecessarily because I haven't optimized the database queries in months. The contradiction just sits there. Everyone around me actually present for the cause and I'm half-absent, and when I finally got home and fixed the bug I felt guilty about leaving the march early. Can't even show up properly for one thing. One of the other marchers recognized me from the legal aid translation sessions and asked if I'd be at next week's meeting and I said probably but honestly I don't know, February's been wall to wall at work and something has to give. Just don't know what.

**Nudge:** "What would it mean if translation sessions are what gives?"

**Response:** There's other translators. They'd manage.

Skipped the refugee coding class again. That's twice this month.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-12

Got an email from the nonprofit asking if I'm still available for Tuesday sessions because they need to know for scheduling and I just stared at it for like twenty minutes. The honest answer is no probably not consistently anymore but saying that out loud feels like giving up on something that actually mattered, like I moved here and told myself I wouldn't become one of those tech people who just works and makes money and stops caring about anything real. But I'm so tired all the time and the promotion means more meetings and Ana's talking about maybe trying to buy a place in a few years which means we need to actually save.

Mamá called yesterday asking when I'm coming to visit and I realized I haven't been back to Medellín in almost a year. She didn't say anything but I could hear it.

**Nudge:** "What did you hear in your mom's silence?"

**Response:** Disappointment, I guess. That I'm too busy for them now. Which isn't fair but also maybe it's accurate.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-18

Sent the email to the nonprofit coordinator saying I need to step back from the Tuesday class for a few months, work commitments, maybe pick it back up in summer. She was understanding, said the spot would be there when I'm ready, which somehow made it worse because it's just so easy to walk away from things when everyone's nice about it. Closed my laptop after and Ana asked if I was okay and I said yeah fine but really I kept thinking about Miguel, this sixteen year old Syrian kid who barely spoke English two months ago and last week showed me a working calculator app he built on his own. Someone else will help him now and that's fine, it's fine, people are replaceable in these programs that's kind of the point so no one person is critical.

Took the promotion. Starts next month. More money, better title, meetings about meetings probably. Told myself I'd put some of the raise toward donations but we'll see if that actually happens once rent and everything else gets factored in.

**Nudge:** "People are replaceable - is that what bothers you?"

**Response:** Just tired. It's done now anyway.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-18

Look, I know how this sounds but I can't be everything to everyone all the time. That's not sustainable and pretending it is just leads to burnout and then I'm no help to anyone. The legal aid group still gets my translations when they need them, I can do that remotely on my schedule, and the money from this promotion means I can actually contribute financially to causes instead of just volunteering time I don't have anymore. That's still impact, maybe more efficient impact honestly because they need funding more than they need my specific presence at every single meeting.

Ana and I walked to the cafe this morning and just sat there for an hour not talking about work or organizations or what I should be doing, just sitting, and it felt good. Felt human. I'm allowed to have a life that isn't just constant guilt about not doing enough for problems I can't personally solve. That's reasonable.

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-18

Still thinking about this morning. The cafe thing. We used to do that more when I first moved here, just exist together without an agenda. Somewhere along the way everything became a transaction - time spent here means time not spent there, money on coffee means money not donated, relaxing means not paying attention to what's going wrong in the world.

Maybe Ana's right that I've been making myself miserable trying to optimize every choice. The Miguel thing still stings but the coordinator already found someone to take over the class and apparently the transition went fine. The work goes on without me. That's good, that's how it should be.

## Entry 8 - 2025-02-23

First week in the new role was actually manageable, more meetings yeah but not the nightmare I'd built up in my head. Team seems solid, project is interesting enough, hours are reasonable so far. Got home at six yesterday and just cooked dinner with Ana, no laptop open, no phone checking Slack. Realized halfway through that I wasn't thinking about what else I should be doing, just was there chopping vegetables and listening to her talk about her day.

Still doing translation work on Sundays when the legal aid requests come in. Found a rhythm that doesn't feel like I'm constantly failing at everything. Not sure if this is balance or just compromise or giving up, honestly can't tell the difference anymore, but it's livable. That counts for something.
