Staff meeting today went exactly as I expected. I presented the new curriculum framework I developed, and the principal asked me to lead the implementation committee. It feels right to be the one steering this.

**Nudge:** "What made this feel 'right' to you?"

**Response:** I mean, someone capable needed to do it. The previous attempts at curriculum reform were disasters.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-03

Just got home after spending four extra hours at school working on the implementation timeline. My eyes hurt from staring at spreadsheets and my back is killing me from hunching over my laptop in that awful staffroom chair. But I couldn't leave it to anyone else - Rajan would have scheduled everything too loosely and Anita would have forgotten half the stakeholders.

I keep thinking about how the other coordinators looked at me during the meeting when the principal announced I'd be leading this. Some of them have been teaching for fifteen years. I could see Mrs. D'Souza's jaw tighten. She probably thinks she deserved it more. Maybe by seniority she did. But seniority doesn't mean capability. I've seen her departmental reviews - they're surface-level at best.

The thing is, I know I'm good at this. I know I can execute better than anyone else in that room. But knowing that and having to constantly prove it are two different kinds of exhausting. My mother called asking why I missed dinner. I told her I was working on something important. She said "important to whom?" I didn't have an answer that would satisfy her.

**Nudge:** "Your mother's question stayed with you - why?"

**Response:** She just doesn't understand how things work in a professional environment. You can't coast on reputation alone.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-08

Had a difficult conversation with Rajan today. He said I was "micromanaging" the committee and that other members felt they couldn't contribute meaningfully. I told him that if people had strong ideas, they were welcome to share them, but I wasn't going to lower standards just to make everyone feel included. That's not how you get results.

He brought up that I'd rewritten three different people's section drafts over the weekend without consulting them first. Okay, yes, I did that. But those drafts were genuinely weak. Was I supposed to just submit substandard work because someone might feel bad? He kept saying something about "buy-in" and "ownership" but honestly it felt like he was more concerned with feelings than outcomes. I don't have time for that.

**Nudge:** "What would it cost you to let their work stand?"

Principal approved my revised timeline without changes. Committee meeting tomorrow - I've pre-assigned all discussion topics to keep things focused. Sent calendar invites with required reading materials.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-13

Interesting thing happened today - one of my Class 10 students, Arjun, stayed after to ask about the recommendation letter I wrote for him. He got into his top choice school. Said my letter made a difference because it was specific about his leadership in the debate club. His parents are coming to thank me next week apparently, which is... I don't know, it's nice but also slightly awkward.

But it got me thinking about why I pushed so hard to be the coordinator position in the first place. Part of it is obviously that I'm genuinely better at organizing these things than most of my colleagues. But there's also something about having that title, that formal recognition. When I write recommendation letters now, they carry more weight because of my position. When I speak in staff meetings, people listen differently. It's not about ego exactly, it's more like... my ideas actually get implemented instead of just being suggestions that disappear into committee limbo. That matters. That actually changes things for students like Arjun.

**Nudge:** "If not ego, then what would you call it?"

**Response:** Call it whatever you want. The point is Arjun got into his school because I was in a position to help him effectively.
