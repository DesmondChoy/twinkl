# Persona 1d529c71: Luuk Janssen

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 1d529c71
- **Name:** Luuk Janssen
- **Age:** 18-24
- **Profession:** Gig Worker
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Conformity
- **Bio:** Luuk delivers food by bicycle in Utrecht and picks up freelance moving jobs on weekends through an app. He lives in a shared flat with three other guys from his old secondary school, splitting costs down to the cent because none of them earns reliably. His mother calls every Sunday to ask when he will finish his HBO degree, which he paused two semesters ago after falling behind, and he always tells her he is looking into re-enrolling. When disagreements come up in the flat about noise or cleaning, Luuk is usually the one who smooths things over, even if it means scrubbing the kitchen himself at midnight.

Got into it with Sven about the dishes again. I ended up just doing them because it was easier than listening to him say I was making a big deal out of nothing. Whatever. It's done.

**Nudge:** "Does 'easier' actually mean easier?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-31

Sunday dinner at Mam's. She had the whole table set up nicely, the good plates, which she only does when she wants to have a Serious Conversation. Sure enough, between the stamppot and dessert she brought up the HBO thing. She had printed out the re-enrollment deadlines and put them next to my plate. My brother Thijs just kept eating and looking at his phone.

I told her I would look at it this week. Same thing I said last month. She nodded like she believed me, which almost made it worse. The bike ride home was long and cold and I kept rehearsing what I could have said instead. Something like, I do not actually know if I want to go back. But I could see exactly how her face would change if I said that, so I didn't.

The flat was quiet when I got home. I made tea and sat in the kitchen for a while. There is this crack in the ceiling tile above the stove that I keep meaning to tell the landlord about but never do.

**Nudge:** "What would her face do?"

**Response:** That thing where she goes quiet and her mouth gets tight and she starts clearing plates even though no one is finished. I have seen it once before, when Thijs dropped out for good. I cannot be the second one.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-03

Had a decent shift today. Twelve deliveries, no flats, tips were okay. There was this moment around six when I dropped off Thai food to this older woman in Lombok and she said, oh you are always so polite, I recognise your bicycle. That stuck with me for some reason. I do not get told things like that a lot.

On the ride back to the centre I was thinking about how the delivery thing actually suits me in some ways. You show up, you do the route, people are happy to see you because you have their food. Nobody asks you to have an opinion. You just do the thing correctly and move on. Thijs thinks it is a dead-end but he also quit his warehouse job after three weeks because the manager annoyed him. I would never do that. Even when dispatch sends me across the city for a single order, I just go.

I stopped at the Albert Heijn on Voorstraat and bought stroopwafels for the flat. Sven was actually in a good mood and we watched some Champions League highlights. Felt normal. Felt like how things should be.

## Entry 3 - 2025-04-05

Moving job today with a guy named Daan who I got paired with through the app. We shifted a whole studio flat's worth of furniture from Overvecht to De Meern. Tight stairwells, a couch that did not fit through the door the normal way. The usual.

Daan is one of those people who talks constantly while working, which is fine. He was going on about how the platform takes too big a cut and we should negotiate for better rates. He wanted me to sign some kind of group message to the company. I said yeah, maybe, and kept carrying boxes. I do not really see the point. They would just replace us. There are fifty other guys who would take the jobs tomorrow.

After we finished, the client gave us both twenty extra in cash, which was nice. I biked home through Amelisweerd because the weather was good. Made pasta, did some laundry. Texted Mam a photo of dinner because she worries I do not eat properly.

**Nudge:** "Would you actually want better rates though?"

**Response:** Obviously yeah. But signing group complaints is how you get flagged as difficult. I have seen guys lose their ratings over stuff like that. Not worth it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-04-09

Marco from downstairs knocked on our door at half ten to say the music was too loud. It was not even my music, it was Sven and Bram watching some livestream thing, but I was the one who answered the door so I was the one who apologised. I turned the volume down myself before going back to my room. Nobody asked me to and nobody thanked me for it.

I lay in bed thinking about the fact that I always seem to end up being the one who makes the peace. When Marco has a problem, he knocks. When Mam has a worry, she calls. When the flat is a mess, somehow I notice first. It is not that I mind exactly, it just does not seem to work the other way around. If I am annoyed about something I keep it to myself because bringing it up would be more hassle than it is worth.

Delivery earnings were average this week. Weather is supposed to get warmer, which means more cyclists on the road competing for the same orders. I need to figure out a better evening route.

**Nudge:** "What would 'working the other way around' look like?"

**Response:** Someone noticing that I cleaned the kitchen without me saying anything. Or Sven turning the music down before Marco even has to come up. Just people paying attention the way I pay attention. Probably asking too much.

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-16

Mam rang and said Thijs told her I have not actually looked into re-enrolling. I do not even know how he knows that. I sat there on the phone saying nothing while she asked me if I have a plan and all I could think was, why did he have to say anything.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-16

Went out for a ride after the call to clear my head. Ended up doing three deliveries even though I was not on shift. It helped. Moving helps. You do not have to think about what to say to anyone when you are just pedalling.

**Nudge:** "What would you say if you let yourself?"

**Response:** That I stopped because the lectures made me feel stupid and I was too embarrassed to tell anyone. That's it really. Not complicated.

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-21

Flat meeting tonight because the lease renewal is coming up. We all sat around the kitchen table and Bram said he might not sign because his girlfriend wants them to get their own place. Sven immediately started talking about who could replace him, rent shares, logistics. I just sat there doing maths in my head.

What I did not say is that if Bram leaves, the dynamic changes completely. Bram is the easy one, the one who never starts arguments. Without him it is me, Sven, and whoever new, and I already know I will be the one making sure everything stays smooth. I almost said something about it but Sven was already moving on to the internet bill, so I let it go.

**Nudge:** "What were you about to say before you let it go?"

**Response:** That maybe we should talk about whether we actually all want to keep living together, not just whether the numbers work. But Sven had already moved on and bringing it back up would have felt like I was making it a bigger thing than it needed to be.
