## Entry 0 - 2025-02-11

Spent most of the afternoon sourcing fabric swatches with Diya at this tiny warehouse in Camp. The guy running the place kept talking about minimum order quantities and I could see her doing math in her head, getting stressed. I just wanted to touch everything, feel the weight of it. Found this insane indigo block-print that would be perfect for the bomber jackets we've been sketching.

On the rickshaw back I was thinking about how three months ago I was sitting in a lecture hall pretending to care about supply chain management and now I'm actually doing it, badly, in real life. The irony isn't lost on me. Mum called while I was out but I let it ring. Didn't feel like hearing about Priya's wedding venue shortlist again.

**Nudge:** "What happens when you do pick up those calls?"

**Response:** Same script every time. How's the business, when am I coming home, did I hear Priya's news. I just run out of ways to sound enthusiastic.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-15

Pop-up at Koregaon Park went well. Sold eleven pieces including two of the bomber prototypes. One girl asked if we had an Instagram — we do, but it's barely set up. Diya handled the money stuff while I talked to people. That part I'm good at. Strangers telling me they like something I made with my hands, that's a specific kind of high.

Afterwards we went to this new rooftop bar Adi told me about. Spent way too much on cocktails but the music was perfect and the city looked ridiculous from up there. Diya said it was our "revenue celebration." We made maybe eight thousand rupees today and spent half of it on drinks and that felt exactly right.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-22

Meeting with a guy who runs a boutique in Viman Nagar. He wants to stock five designs on consignment. The terms aren't great — he takes forty percent — but Diya says the visibility is worth it. I kept looking around his shop thinking about whether our stuff would even fit next to all that boho tourist stuff.

Adi came over after. We ordered biryani and watched some terrible thriller on Netflix. He mentioned his lease is up in April and sort of hinted at us getting a place together. I changed the subject to the boutique deal. Not sure why. It's not like I haven't thought about it.

**Nudge:** "You've thought about it but changed the subject — what came up for you in that moment?"

**Response:** Felt like if I said yes it would become this whole plan, this whole thing with routines and splitting rent and groceries. I like how we are now where it's easy.

Late now, Adi left an hour ago. Finished stitching the last sample for the consignment order and my fingers are sore but the jacket looks exactly how I pictured it. Small win. Going to sleep actually satisfied for once.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-24

Went home for lunch yesterday because Dad's birthday. Mum cornered me in the kitchen to ask if I've "thought about what comes next" if the brand doesn't work out. Priya was right there smiling with her ring and her Infosys lanyard still around her neck like some kind of prop. I know Mum means well but I'm so tired of being the cautionary tale at family gatherings.

I told her I don't have a backup plan because this is the plan. She got quiet in that way she does. Dad just ate his cake and said the jacket I brought him was nice, which honestly was enough. I don't need everyone to get it. The brand is growing, I'm paying my share of rent, I'm not asking anyone for money. I don't know what else there is to prove.

**Nudge:** "You said Dad's comment was enough — was it actually?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-24

Can't sleep, brain won't stop. Thinking about the consignment thing and whether it's a step up or just giving our margins away for the ego of seeing our label in a shop. Diya ran the numbers and we'd need to sell through at least seventy percent to break even after materials. That's tight. But then again if we don't get the stuff in front of new people it just sits in our flat.

Also still chewing on the Adi thing from the other night. It's not that I don't want to be with him, it's that the second you sign a lease with someone the whole shape of your days changes. You eat dinner at the same time, you watch the same shows, you wake up and there's no surprise about who's next to you. That sounds awful when I write it out but I don't mean it in a cruel way. I just like having space where I can decide at midnight to rework a pattern or go meet Diya for chai without explaining.

Maybe I'm overthinking this. He didn't bring it up again and maybe he won't. Part of me kind of wants him to, just so I know he actually means it instead of it being some lease-expiry convenience thing. I should probably eat something, I skipped dinner and my stomach is doing that acidic thing.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-03

Diya wants to pause the brand for a month because she got offered a paid internship at some design studio in Bangalore. She says it's temporary and she'll be back but it felt like the floor shifted. Sat on the balcony after she told me just staring at traffic, not sure what I'm supposed to do with half a brand.

**Nudge:** "What part of this scares you most — the business or doing it alone?"
