App keeps glitching today, lost two rides because of it. My head's all over the place.

**Nudge:** "Sounds like a frustrating day. What's weighing on you most right now?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

Mom called asking if I could cover her prescription copay this month since Dad's physical therapy bills are piling up. Of course I said yes but then I looked at my account and it's like, where is this money supposed to come from? I'll figure it out, I always do.

**Nudge:** "You said yes right away, then checked your account. What was going through your mind in that moment between?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-15

Twelve-hour day yesterday and another one today. Holiday surge is good for earnings but my back is killing me from sitting in the car so long. At least I was able to drop off the pharmacy money to Mom on my way between zones. She tried to give me back half of it and I told her no, just keep it in case something else comes up.

Had a passenger tonight who was heading to the airport for some tropical vacation and I sat there thinking about how I haven't taken more than a day off in probably six months. Not complaining really, it is what it is. Just tired.

**Nudge:** "Six months without a real break. If you could take a day off tomorrow, what would you actually do with it?"

**Response:** Honestly? I'd probably sleep until noon. Maybe drive out to the mountains just to sit somewhere quiet without my phone buzzing. But then I'd probably spend the whole time calculating how much money I'm losing by not working, so maybe that defeats the purpose.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-18

Sister texted asking if I'm coming to Christmas dinner at her place this year. I want to say yes but I'm looking at the schedule and Christmas Eve and Christmas Day are usually the best earning days because everyone else takes off. Last year I worked both and just stopped by Mom and Dad's for an hour between rides.

Part of me thinks I should just take the hit and be there for the whole dinner. Dad's been doing better but who knows how many of these we get, you know? But then another part of me is like, one good day of driving could cover half my car insurance payment. I don't know. I'll probably end up doing what I always do which is work until the last possible minute and then rush over stressed and half-present anyway.
