# Persona 127aefff: Tariq Haddad

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 127aefff
- **Name:** Tariq Haddad
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Grad Student
- **Culture:** Middle Eastern
- **Core Values:** Stimulation, Conformity
- **Bio:** Tariq left a stable engineering position in Amman at thirty-seven to pursue a PhD in computational linguistics in Edinburgh, a decision that baffled his extended family. He shares a cramped flat with two younger students and video-calls his mother every Friday, reassuring her that the degree will lead somewhere respectable. He cycles through side projects — a podcast pilot, an Arabic NLP dataset, a half-built app — and struggles to sit with any single task long enough to finish it. When his department chair suggested he narrow his thesis scope, Tariq agreed immediately in the meeting, then spent the evening restless, sketching out three alternative directions on a napkin.

## Entry 0 - 2025-06-05

Got an email from my cousin Faris today, forwarding photos from his daughter's first birthday party back in Amman. The whole family was there — uncles, aunts, my mother holding the baby with that particular look she gets. I was not invited to skip it; I just was not there. No one said anything pointed but the group chat went quiet for a while after the photos dropped and I could feel the space where my name should have been.

Nothing happened, really. I ate leftover lentil soup, re-read a paper on morphological parsing, tried to focus. My flatmate Callum asked if I wanted to go to a pub quiz and I said no, then sat there wishing I had said yes.

**Nudge:** "What was the quiet in the group chat about?"

**Response:** It is not that they are angry. It is that they have stopped expecting me to show up. That is worse, I think. Like I have been reclassified from "absent" to "gone."

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-12

Supervisor meeting. Dr. Keane asked me to commit to one research question by next Friday and I heard myself say yes, absolutely, no problem. Walked home and could not stop thinking about the three other directions I had sketched out last month.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from pushing back in the meeting?"

**Response:** Because pushing back feels like making a scene, and I do not make scenes. My father never raised his voice in a meeting in his life. But I keep wondering if the question I pick will be the one that bores me by October.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-13

Library until six. Drafted the introduction for the narrowed thesis proposal, which took longer than it should have because I kept second-guessing paragraph transitions. Callum and I walked to the chippie on Clerk Street after.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-14

Friday call with my mother went well for once. She asked about the thesis and I described the morphological analysis angle in simple terms — how computers learn to break Arabic words into their root pieces. She said it sounded useful, which from her is high praise.

I felt like myself on that call. Not performing, not deflecting her questions about when I am coming home. Just explaining something I actually care about to someone who wanted to listen. She even asked a follow-up about how the root system works differently in dialects. Small thing, but it settled something in me.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-14

Second entry today because my brain will not shut off. After the call with my mother I went for a walk up Arthur's Seat. Halfway up I got this rush of clarity — or maybe it was just adrenaline — where I started thinking about what it would look like to pivot my thesis entirely. Not the careful narrowing Dr. Keane wants. Something bigger. Cross-linguistic transfer models for under-resourced dialects. Levantine, Gulf, Maghrebi. My heart was actually racing on the hill and it was not from the climb.

Then I sat on the bench at the top and the wind hit me and I thought about what pivoting would mean. Another meeting with Keane where I contradict what I said three days ago. My mother asking again when I will finish. My uncle Hisham, who helped fund the first year, shaking his head at another delay. Everyone back home already thinks this PhD was an impulsive detour, and changing direction again would prove them right.

So I walked back down, made tea, opened the narrowed proposal draft. Still sitting here with it. The cursor is blinking at the end of paragraph three and I have not typed anything in forty minutes.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you brought the bigger idea to Keane?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-19

Department social last night at The Pear Tree. I went because Dr. Keane mentioned it would be good to show face, and I know what that means in academic circles — it means attendance is optional in the way that prayer is optional at a family gathering. So I went.

Ended up in a long conversation with Priya from the NLP group. She is working on code-switching detection in Hindi-English tweets and the way she talked about it — with this specific, focused energy — made me jealous. Not of the topic. Of the certainty. She has her question, her method, her timeline. She did not seem to need a detour.

I told her about the dialect transfer idea. She said it sounded fascinating and asked why I was not doing it. I said timing, funding, the usual. She shrugged and said "those are real constraints" in a way that felt like she was politely letting me off the hook. I appreciated it and hated it at the same time.

**Nudge:** "What did you want her to say instead?"

**Response:** Something like "do it anyway." Or "those are excuses." Someone outside the family orbit giving me permission to be reckless. Which is ridiculous because I am thirty-eight years old and should not need permission from a colleague I barely know.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-26

Submitted the narrowed thesis proposal to Dr. Keane this morning. Forty-two pages, bibliography cleaned up, research questions scoped to morphological segmentation for Modern Standard Arabic. Felt like handing in a homework assignment I had done properly rather than one that kept me up at night, but there is something to be said for finishing.

Callum and I cooked mansaf tonight — or my version of it, which involves Greek yogurt because Edinburgh does not have decent jameed. He kept asking questions about the spices and I caught myself explaining things the way my mother does, with small corrections and zero patience. Made me laugh.

After dinner I sat with my laptop and, almost without thinking about it, opened a blank document and started outlining the dialect transfer idea. Not as a thesis. Just notes. No one has to see it. I wrote for an hour and it was the most alive I have felt in front of a screen in weeks.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-27

My uncle Hisham called today. Not the usual Friday family call — a separate, pointed call. He asked how the PhD was going and I told him I submitted the proposal. He said good, asked about the timeline, and then said he hoped I was not "chasing new rabbits" — his phrase, not mine. Apparently my mother mentioned something about dialect research and he connected dots.

I told him everything was on track, the proposal was submitted, Dr. Keane was happy. All true. I did not mention the outline document from last night. It is not lying. It is managing information. People share what is relevant and I shared what was relevant.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-29

Went to the Edinburgh Farmers' Market at Castle Terrace this morning, mostly for the za'atar bread from the Lebanese stall. Ran into Priya and her partner. We talked about the summer conference circuit and she mentioned a workshop on low-resource NLP in Copenhagen in September. She looked at me when she said it, like she knew.

I came home and emailed Dr. Keane asking for a meeting next week. Just to discuss, I wrote. I did not say what about. But I printed out the dialect transfer outline and put it in my bag. Maybe I will bring it, maybe I will not. It is in the bag though. That feels like enough for today.

**Nudge:** "Why print it out if you might not show it?"

**Response:** Because I need to know it is there. Like a door I have not walked through yet but I can see. If I leave it at home it is just a file on my laptop. In the bag it is something I chose to carry. I think I am going to show it. I think I have been working up to this for weeks and I just did not want to admit it because admitting it means it matters, and if it matters then Keane saying no will actually hurt.
