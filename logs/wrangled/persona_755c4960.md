# Persona 755c4960: Kevin Lim

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 755c4960
- **Name:** Kevin Lim
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Entrepreneur
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Tradition
- **Bio:** Kevin runs a small tech consultancy in Singapore that he started two years ago after leaving his father's import-export business. His parents still bring up how his grandfather built the family company from nothing, and his mother asks weekly when he will "come back to help." He visits his grandmother every Sunday for dinner, never missing it even when deadlines pile up, and keeps a small shrine in his apartment that he tends to even though most of his friends would find it old-fashioned.

Lit the incense this morning before the client call. Small thing, but my grandmother would approve. Felt steadier going into the pitch.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-14

Met up with Jason and Wei Liang for drinks after work. They kept asking about my "startup life" with that tone they always have, like it's some extended gap year before I grow up and take over the family business like I'm supposed to.

I didn't argue this time. Just said business is fine, ordered another Tiger, changed the subject to Jason's wedding plans. I'm tired of defending myself. They don't understand that I can run my own thing and still be a good son. Those aren't opposites.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-15

Sunday dinner at Ah Ma's was the usual. She made her braised pork belly the way she's made it for forty years, using the same clay pot that belonged to her mother. I watched her in the kitchen for a bit while everyone else was in the living room watching the news. She moves slower now but she still won't let anyone help with the cooking.

My cousin Melissa brought her new boyfriend, some finance guy from Hong Kong. Ah Ma was polite but I could tell she didn't like that he only spoke English and didn't touch the pig's ear dish. Little things. After dinner she pulled me aside and asked about my business. Not in the way my parents ask, like they're waiting for me to fail. She just wanted to know if I was eating enough and sleeping enough. Then she said her father also left his village to try something new, and that took courage, but he always sent money home. She wasn't lecturing. Just telling me.

I don't know why that hit different. Maybe because she's the one person who doesn't make me feel like I'm choosing between two lives.

**Nudge:** "What makes her different from the others?"

**Response:** She's lived through actual hard things. The war, losing her first shop, raising five kids. I think she just has perspective that my parents don't. They grew up comfortable because she made it possible. So now they're anxious about protecting what they have. She already knows you can lose everything and rebuild.

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-15

Still thinking about what Ah Ma said about her father. I looked up the village name after I got home. It's in Fujian, some small place I can barely find on the map. He left with nothing and built something in Singapore. Opened a provisions shop. That became my grandfather's import business. That became my father's company.

And I left that to start a tech consultancy. Three generations of building, and I walked away. At least that's how my father sees it. He's never said it directly but I can feel it every time we talk. Like I've broken some chain.

But Ah Ma's father left too. He left his family, his village, everything familiar. And that's why any of us are here. So why is my leaving different? Maybe because I'm not leaving out of necessity. I'm leaving because I want something else. Maybe that's what they can't forgive.

**Nudge:** "Is it something they can't forgive, or something you can't?"

**Response:** Both, probably. I don't know if I've actually forgiven myself for not wanting what they want for me. Every time the business does well, part of me wonders if I'm just proving I was right to leave. And every time it struggles, I wonder if I should have just stayed.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-20

Closed the deal with the logistics company. Three-month engagement, decent budget. Should keep the lights on through Q2.

Called my mother to tell her. She said "that's good" and then asked if I'm coming back for Qing Ming next week. Didn't ask anything about the contract. I said yes, I'll be there.

**Nudge:** "How did that feel, her not asking about it?"

---

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-26

Qing Ming was fine. We went to the cemetery at 6am before it got too crowded. I helped my father carry the offerings, burned the paper money, did the three bows. Same as every year.

My uncle asked when I'm going to "stop playing" and help run the real business. Right there at my grandfather's grave. I just smiled and said business is good. Didn't want to cause a scene. But I kept thinking, would Gong Gong have been disappointed in me too? He built something from nothing. I'm building something from nothing. It's not the same thing, but it's not that different either. I wanted to say that. I didn't.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from saying it?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-28

Fight with my father tonight. Real one, not the passive aggressive stuff. He came to my apartment unannounced, said he was "in the area" which is never true. He saw my laptop open with the client dashboard and started asking questions. Then he said he doesn't understand why I need to prove something when there's already a business that needs me.

I tried to explain that I'm not proving anything. I just want to build my own thing. He said his father didn't have the luxury of wanting. He had to build because there was no other choice. Then he said "you have a choice and you're choosing wrong."

I don't remember exactly what I said back but it was something about how maybe I'm not wrong, maybe he just can't see it because he never had to question what he was supposed to do. He left without finishing his tea.

My mother called an hour later to say he's just worried about me. I know. I know he's worried. But being worried doesn't make him right.

**Nudge:** "What happened after you hung up with your mom?"

**Response:** I sat on the couch for a while. Didn't do anything. Then I cleaned the apartment, which I do when I'm upset. Washed the teacup he didn't finish. Went to bed early but couldn't sleep. Kept replaying what I should have said differently.

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-04

Went to the temple with Ah Ma this morning. She goes on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month, always has. I don't usually join but I had time and she seemed pleased when I offered.

We lit joss sticks and she showed me how to hold them properly, three in both hands, bow three times. She does it with such certainty. I like that about her generation. They don't question these things. They just do them because their parents did them and their parents before that. I used to think that was mindless but now I think maybe there's something to just... participating. Being part of something older than yourself.

## Entry 8 - 2025-04-10

Had to turn down a potential client today. They wanted me to work on a project for their online gambling platform. Good money, probably six months of runway. But I kept thinking about what my parents would say if they found out. Not that they would, but still.

My grandfather's name is on my business registration. Lim Wei Keong Consulting Pte Ltd. I named it after him because I wanted to feel connected to something larger than just me and my laptop. So when I thought about taking money from a gambling company, it felt wrong. Like I was attaching his name to something he would have disapproved of.

I don't even know if he would have cared. He died when I was twelve. I barely remember his voice. But I remember my grandmother saying he never gambled, not even mahjong, because his own father lost everything that way. So I said no to the client. Probably stupid from a business standpoint. But it felt like the right thing.

**Nudge:** "What do you actually remember about him?"

**Response:** Mostly just impressions. The smell of his pipe tobacco. His hands, very rough, always moving. He used to let me stamp the shipping documents with the company chop when I visited the warehouse. Made me feel important. I remember his funeral more clearly than I remember him alive. Everyone crying. The paper house they burned for him. My father reading the eulogy in a voice I'd never heard before.

## Entry 9 - 2025-04-15

Mother's birthday dinner at the seafood restaurant in Geylang. The one we've been going to since I was a kid. Same lazy Susan, same chili crab, same argument about who's paying the bill.

Dad and I didn't talk much but it wasn't hostile. Just quiet. I gave her a jade bracelet, the kind she likes. She cried a little, said I didn't have to spend money on her. Then she asked if I'm eating properly. Same as always.

**Nudge:** "Where do things stand with your dad now?"

**Response:** Same as always. He's stubborn, I'm stubborn. We'll figure it out eventually. Or we won't. Family, right?

## Entry 10 - 2025-04-16

Client emergency all day. Their website went down during a promotion and I had to fix it remotely while pretending to work from a cafe because my home internet was out. By the time everything was stable it was 9pm and I'd missed Sunday dinner at Ah Ma's.

First time I've missed in maybe two years. I called to apologize and she said it's okay, she saved me some food. But I could hear something in her voice. Not anger, just... something. Like she was expecting this would happen eventually. Like she's been waiting for me to become the kind of person who misses family dinners for work.

I am that person now, I guess. The kind who chooses the client over the grandmother. My father probably missed a hundred family dinners building the company. My grandfather probably did too. So why does it feel different when I do it? Maybe because I was supposed to be different. I was supposed to be the generation that has it figured out. The one who doesn't have to sacrifice everything.

**Nudge:** "What did you think you were supposed to be?"

## Entry 11 - 2025-04-19

Picked up the leftover braised pork from Ah Ma's this afternoon. She'd kept it in the fridge all week, even though I told her she could give it to someone else. Stubborn woman. I sat with her for a while in the living room, watching her fold paper offerings for the upcoming Vesak Day.

She didn't mention me missing dinner. Just asked about business and whether I was sleeping. Then she told me a story about my grandfather I hadn't heard before. Apparently he used to sneak out of family dinners early to check on the warehouse. His own mother would scold him. "The goods won't walk away," she'd say. But he couldn't help it. She laughed telling me this. Said I reminded her of him. First time anyone's said that in a way that wasn't a complaint.

**Nudge:** "What did it mean to hear that from her?"

**Response:** I don't know. Good, I guess. Like maybe I'm not as lost as I thought. Or at least I'm lost in a way that runs in the family.
