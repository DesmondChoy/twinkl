## Entry 0 - 2025-07-05

The office was quiet today, most of the team out for the holiday weekend. I stayed because there was a deployment window and someone needed to be there. Rima asked why I didn't just let the junior handle it. I told her it's not about trust, it's about making sure nothing breaks while the client's systems are live.

Seventeen years at this company. The chair in my office has molded to my shape. There's something comforting about that, even if it sounds pathetic written down. I know every hallway, every server room, every shortcut in the build system. That knowledge is worth something.

**Nudge:** "What makes you say it sounds pathetic?"

**Response:** Because my cousin Fadi started his own consultancy two years ago and everyone at family dinners talks about him like he discovered electricity. Nobody asks me about my work. I think staying in one place for this long makes people assume you had no other options.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-09

Got pulled into a meeting about "organizational restructuring." They didn't say layoffs but the room felt like a dentist's waiting area. My manager kept using phrases like "right-sizing" and "strategic realignment." I sat there nodding, taking notes, asking no questions.

Afterwards I walked to the parking lot and just sat in the car for twenty minutes. Checked the bank app, checked the savings, did the math again. If they let me go tomorrow, we'd be fine for six months. Maybe seven if we cut the girls' tutoring. But that's not the point. The point is I shouldn't have to be doing this math.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned asking no questions. What would you have asked?"

**Response:** Whether my department is on the list. Whether seventeen years counts for anything. But you don't ask those things in front of everyone. You wait, you read the room, you figure it out without making yourself a target.

No news on the restructuring. Business as usual. Finished the API migration ahead of schedule. Had lunch with Marwan from the infrastructure team. He's been here twelve years and seemed calm about the whole thing. Said he's not worried because his brother-in-law works in HR. Must be nice.

Rima's mother is visiting next week. Started cleaning the guest room. The girls are complaining about having to be "presentable" all weekend. I told them it's three days, they'll survive.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-19

Rima's mother made a comment about how I should "think bigger" and maybe start something of my own like Fadi. I smiled and poured her more coffee. What does she want me to say? That I'm keeping her daughter's life stable while her golden nephew burns through investor money?

**Nudge:** "What did Rima say when her mother said that?"

**Response:** Nothing. She changed the subject to the girls' school. Which is its own kind of answer, I suppose. She knows I don't want to hear it, so she steers away. I'm grateful for that, but also wondering what she actually thinks.

## Entry 4 - 2025-07-24

A recruiter reached out on LinkedIn. Startup in Dubai, fintech, "ground floor opportunity." The salary would be higher but it's a two-year contract with no guarantees after that. I looked at the job description for maybe fifteen minutes, then closed the tab.

Rima would say I should at least talk to them. My father would have said a bird in the hand. I keep thinking about what happens if the restructuring goes through and I turned down the one door that opened. But I also keep thinking about what happens if I jump and there's nothing underneath.

**Nudge:** "What would you need to know to feel okay about either choice?"

**Response:** Honestly, I don't think any amount of information would make me feel okay about it. Some decisions just feel wrong no matter which way you go.

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-31

Thursday already. Week went by fast. Shipped the authentication module, got a thumbs up from the client. The restructuring email came out finally, my department is safe. No cuts in engineering. Marwan was right, his brother-in-law probably knew the whole time.

Funny how relief doesn't feel like happiness. It feels like unclenching. Like you've been holding your jaw tight for weeks and suddenly you notice the ache. Took the girls out for ice cream after work. Layla asked why I was being "weird and nice." Teenagers are brutal.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-07

Team offsite today. The new VP of Engineering flew in from the head office in Riyadh and gave a presentation about "innovation culture" and "embracing disruption." Half the slides had stock photos of people jumping off cliffs. I wanted to ask him if he's ever actually jumped off anything, but I kept my mouth shut and clapped when everyone else clapped.

During the breakout session, one of the younger engineers, Sara, pitched an idea to rewrite our core platform in a new framework. She was passionate, articulate, the VP loved it. I could see at least fifteen ways it would break our existing integrations. But the room was electric, everyone was nodding, and I wasn't going to be the old guy who kills momentum.

After the session, my manager asked me privately what I thought. I told him the migration would take eighteen months minimum and we'd lose two major clients during the transition. He nodded and said "that's why I need you in the room, Nabil." Which is supposed to be a compliment but felt more like being told my job is to be the brakes on everyone else's engine.

I don't want to be the person who always says no. But someone has to think about what we'd lose.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to say what you think without being 'the brakes'?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-13

Had the annual review. "Exceeds expectations" across the board. My manager wrote that I'm "the backbone of the engineering team" and "a stabilizing presence during periods of change." I should feel good about this. I do feel good about it.

Rima asked what they said and I told her. She smiled and said "of course." Like it was obvious. Like there was never any doubt. And maybe that's the thing that bothers me — not that people expect me to be reliable, but that nobody finds it surprising.

**Nudge:** "What would you want them to find surprising?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe that I had an idea they didn't expect. That I pushed for something risky and it worked. But that's not me, and I'm not sure I actually want it to be. I just want the option to be seen differently, even if I never use it.

## Entry 8 - 2025-08-19

Quiet week. Wrapped up documentation for the Q3 release. Took the girls to their grandmother's on Saturday. Drove back along the coast road instead of the highway. Rima fell asleep in the passenger seat. Good drive.
