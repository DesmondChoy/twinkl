## Entry 0 - 2025-10-07

My sister asked me if I was "doing okay" on the phone last night with that voice she uses when she's actually asking if I'm depressed. I'm not depressed. I made banana bread with Olive yesterday and we painted rocks in the backyard and I reorganized the entire pantry because it was driving me insane. That's not depression, that's Tuesday.

She doesn't get it because she's single and works in marketing and goes to Barcelona on a whim. Good for her. I chose this. I'm not sitting here wishing I had her life. I just wish mine had a few more surprise elements built in. Like a plot twist every now and then. Something I didn't see coming at 6am when I set the cereal bowls out.

**Nudge:** "What kind of plot twist are you hoping for?"

**Response:** Honestly? I don't even know. That's the part that scares me. I can't name the thing I want. I just know the absence of it. Like there's a shape missing from my week and I keep filling it with pantry organization and sourdough starters.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-12

Spent three hours at a pumpkin patch watching kids run in circles. I stood there holding juice boxes like a human vending machine. Got home and Kyle asked how my day was and I said "fine" and went to bed at 8:30.

**Nudge:** "What would've made it better?"

**Response:** It was fine. Kids had fun. That's the point, right?

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-18

Signed up for a ceramics class on Thursday evenings. Kyle said he'd handle bedtime. First class is next week. Already looking forward to getting my hands dirty with something that isn't Play-Doh.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-23

First ceramics class happened. Small studio off Broadway, eight people, mostly women, a couple retirees, one guy who looked like he was there because of a breakup. The instructor is this woman named Greta who has clay permanently embedded in her fingernails and talks about centering the clay like it's a spiritual practice.

I threw my first cylinder and it collapsed immediately. The second one wobbled but held. Greta said I had "aggressive hands" which I think was a compliment. My nails are ruined and I got clay in my hair and I didn't check my phone once in two hours. Didn't even think about it.

Drove home with the windows down even though it was forty degrees. Played music loud. Walked in the door and the house was quiet, kids asleep, Kyle on the couch watching something about the stock market. He asked if I had fun. I said yes. He said "good" and went back to his show.

I stood in the kitchen eating leftover pasta straight from the container and felt something I haven't felt in a while. Not happiness exactly. More like I'd briefly been someone else. Or maybe someone I used to be.

**Nudge:** "Someone else, or someone you used to be?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe both. Maybe they're the same thing at this point.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-28

Can't sleep. Kyle is snoring. I'm in the kitchen with the light over the stove and my phone and a glass of wine that I'm pretending is just one glass even though I refilled it.

Looked at flights to Mexico. Not for any reason. Just wanted to see how much it would cost. $340 round trip to Puerto Vallarta. That's less than what I spend on groceries in a week for this family. I could go for a weekend. I won't. But I could.

Scrolled through my old Instagram from 2017, before Olive was born. There's a photo of me at a music festival in Austin with body paint on my arms and a flower crown and I'm laughing so hard my eyes are closed. I don't recognize that person. Or I do, but she feels like a character from a show I watched a long time ago. The plot moved on and she got written out.

The wine is warm now. I should go to bed. Tomorrow is a half day at school for Mason which means I need to figure out lunch and an afternoon activity and probably a trip to Target because he needs new sneakers. Again. Nine-year-old boys destroy shoes like it's a competitive sport.

I just want one day where I don't know what's going to happen next. Where the schedule doesn't exist and I can just follow whatever sounds interesting. Is that so unreasonable?

**Nudge:** "What would you actually do with that day?"

**Response:** Drive somewhere I've never been. No map. Stop when something catches my eye. Eat at a restaurant where I can't read the menu. Talk to strangers. Stay out past dark. I've thought about it enough that I have a whole itinerary, which kind of defeats the purpose.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-28

Same night, still up. Kyle got up to use the bathroom and saw me in the kitchen and asked what I was doing. I said "just thinking." He said "about what?" and I said "nothing" and he shrugged and went back to bed. That's the whole conversation. That's what passes for connection at midnight in this house.

I'm not blaming him. He works. He's tired. He handles bedtime when I go to ceramics. He doesn't complain. But he also doesn't ask. Not really. He asks the way you ask a coworker in the elevator. "How was your day?" is not the same as "How are you?" and neither of those is the same as "What do you need?"

Nobody asks me what I need. I'm the person who asks everyone else. What do you want for lunch. Did you brush your teeth. Where's your backpack. Do you need a jacket. I am a logistics coordinator for four other humans and my own needs are somewhere on page twelve of a to-do list that only goes to page three.

I know how this sounds. I know every parent feels this way sometimes. I know I'm not special. I know people have real problems and mine is that I'm bored and restless in a nice house in Littleton, Colorado with a functioning dishwasher and a husband who doesn't yell. I know that. But knowing it doesn't make the feeling go away. It just makes me feel guilty for having it.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-02

Halloween aftermath. Candy wrappers everywhere. Olive had a meltdown over her princess costume ripping. Mason ate too much sugar and threw up. Lucy was fine because Lucy is always fine. I picked glitter out of the carpet for forty minutes.

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-04

Second ceramics class. Made a bowl that actually looks like a bowl. Greta said my centering is improving. Hands are sore. Good sore. The kind of tired that means you did something, not the kind that means the day happened to you.

## Entry 8 - 2025-11-05

Kyle and I had takeout Thai after the kids went down. He mentioned his office is doing a retreat to Tahoe in January. No partners. I said "sounds fun" and meant it, but also felt something heavy settle in my stomach.

**Nudge:** "What was the heavy thing?"

**Response:** Jealousy, I think. Not of Tahoe. Of having something on the calendar that's just for you. That nobody scheduled for you. That you get to anticipate without coordinating childcare first.

## Entry 9 - 2025-11-08

Parent-teacher conference for Mason. Teacher said he's doing well in math, needs work on reading comprehension. Brought cupcakes for Lucy's class birthday. Picked up dry cleaning. Groceries. Normal stuff.

## Entry 10 - 2025-11-11

Olive got sick, so I missed ceramics. Sat in her room rubbing her back while she slept and scrolled through the class group chat watching everyone post photos of their glazed pieces from last week. Mine is still sitting on the drying shelf. Greta texted me separately and said she'd fire it for me.

I know missing one class isn't a big deal. But it felt like something being taken away. Like the universe reminding me that I don't actually get to have my own thing. Every time I carve out something that's mine, a fever or a school closure or a dentist appointment swallows it back up. I sat there watching Olive breathe and felt both tender and trapped at the same time.

**Nudge:** "Can you hold both of those at once?"

## Entry 11 - 2025-11-16

My college friend Dana visited this weekend. She lives in Portland, runs a food truck, just got back from a month in Vietnam. She showed up with good wine and stories about motorbike rides through rice paddies and a tattoo she got from a guy in Hanoi. The kids loved her because she's loud and funny and let them paint her toenails.

After they went to bed she asked me the question everyone eventually asks: "Do you miss working?" And I gave my usual answer which is that I don't miss the job, I miss the energy. The feeling of making something happen. The chaos of event day when everything could go wrong and you're the one holding it together with duct tape and charm.

She said I should start planning events again, freelance. Small stuff. Birthday parties, local festivals. I said maybe. She said "you always say maybe" and she's right. I do always say maybe. Maybe is how you say no without having to defend it.

But here's what I didn't tell Dana. I don't want to plan other people's good times anymore. I want to have my own. I want to be the person at the festival, not the person who booked the porta-potties. I want to be surprised by something. I want to walk into a room and not know what's about to happen. That's what I miss. Not the logistics. The feeling.

Kyle wouldn't understand that. He'd say I can go to a festival anytime. He'd buy me tickets and think he'd solved the problem. But it's not about the ticket. It's about the fact that somewhere along the way, I became the kind of person who needs permission to enjoy things, and I don't know how to undo that.

**Nudge:** "Who are you asking permission from?"

**Response:** Everyone. No one. Myself, probably. I don't know. It's just easier to say maybe and keep making lunches.
