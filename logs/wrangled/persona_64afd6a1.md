## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 64afd6a1
- **Name:** Camila Reyes
- **Age:** 25-34

- **Culture:** Latin American
- **Core Values:** Benevolence
- **Bio:** Camila drives for a rideshare company in Miami and picks up grocery delivery shifts when things are slow. She moved from Colombia five years ago to be closer to her tia Elena, who raised her after her mother passed. Every Sunday she cooks sancocho for whoever shows up at her tiny apartment—sometimes it's just her cousin Diego and his kids, sometimes half the building. She sends money home to her younger brother in Bogota when she can, even when it means eating rice and beans for a week.

People keep telling me I need to set boundaries, like it's so easy. My friend Ana was saying how I should stop lending money to Diego because he never pays me back. But she doesn't understand—he's family. His girls needed new shoes for school and what was I supposed to do, just say no? He's trying his best with that construction job but the hours aren't steady.

I know I can't save everyone. I know that. But when someone in my life needs help and I have even a little bit to give, how do I look them in the eye and say sorry, I'm saving for myself? Maybe I'm the fool here but I'd rather be broke and know I showed up for people than comfortable and wondering if I did enough.

**Nudge:** "You mention maybe being 'the fool' here—what would it look like if you weren't?"

**Response:** Honestly? I don't know if I'd recognize myself. Like, the version of me who doesn't pick up the phone when Diego calls, who doesn't drive 40 minutes to help tia Elena with her groceries... that person feels like a stranger. Sometimes I wonder if I help because I want to or because I'm scared of who I'd be if I stopped. My mom was the same way. She gave and gave until there was nothing left. I don't want to end up like that but I also don't know any other way to be.

Twelve hours of driving today. Picked up tia Elena's medication on my break because the pharmacy was on my route anyway. Just want to sleep.

Diego paid me back today, which surprised me. He said his girls wanted to give me their piggy bank money for helping them. I told them to keep it but I cried in the car after.

**Nudge:** "What was it about that moment that moved you?"

**Response:** I don't know, it was just sweet. Kids being kids. Anyway, it was a good day—better than most this week.

Made tamales with tia Elena for the holidays. She taught me her mother's recipe, the one with the olives. Spent the whole afternoon together, just us and the masa.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-21

My brother called from Bogota—he's struggling with rent again. I already sent what I could last month but I'll figure something out. He's my little brother; that's just what you do.

**Nudge:** "When you say you'll 'figure something out'—what does that usually mean for you?"

**Response:** It means I pick up extra shifts, maybe skip the new tires for another month. It's fine, I've done it before. My brother didn't ask to be born into this situation, you know?

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-27

Tia Elena fell yesterday. She's okay, just bruised, but I wasn't there. I was doing a delivery across town and didn't see her call until an hour later. I should have been there.

**Nudge:** "You were working—how could you have known?"

**Response:** I know, I know. But she lives alone. What if next time it's worse? I've been thinking about asking her to move in with me but my place is so small and she's proud, she wouldn't want to feel like a burden. I don't know.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-01

New Year's Eve was nice, actually. Ana came over with some of the other girls from the building and we did the grape thing at midnight—you know, eating twelve grapes for twelve wishes. Tia Elena made it too, even with her hip still sore. Diego's kids were running around screaming happy new year and setting off these little firecrackers in the parking lot.

I caught myself just standing in the kitchen at one point, watching everyone eat my food and laugh, and I felt... full. Not from the pernil, though that was good too. But like, okay, this is why I do everything. These people, this noise, this mess. Ana asked me what my resolution was and I said to take better care of myself but honestly I don't even know what that means. I've never been good at that part. Taking care of other people is easy—there's always a clear next thing to do. But taking care of myself feels selfish, or maybe I just don't know how.

My cousin said something that stuck with me though. She said you can't pour from an empty cup. I've heard that before but this time it hit different. Maybe because I've been running on empty for months and it's starting to show. Snapping at people in traffic, too tired to cook some nights, just ordering delivery even though I can't afford it. I want to do better this year but I don't know where to start.

**Nudge:** "What's one small thing that would feel like taking care of yourself?"

**Response:** I keep thinking about Sunday mornings. When I was little, before my mom got sick, she used to make herself coffee and sit on the porch alone for like an hour. She called it her "moment." I never understood it then—I thought she was just being lazy. Now I get it. I don't have a porch but I could... I don't know, maybe just sit with my coffee before I start driving. Not check my phone, not worry about who needs what. Just ten minutes of quiet. It sounds so small but I honestly can't remember the last time I did nothing without feeling guilty about it.

I tried the coffee thing this morning. Five minutes in, Diego texted asking if I could watch the girls after school. I said yes before I even finished reading.

**Nudge:** "What would it have felt like to finish your coffee first?"

**Response:** Probably bad, honestly. Like I was choosing myself over them. I know that's not how it works but that's how it feels. Anyway, the girls are fun to have around. It wasn't a sacrifice, just a change of plans.
