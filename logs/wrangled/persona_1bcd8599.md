## Entry 0 - 2025-02-11

Morning handoff and Dr. Salwa walked right over my patient update — just started talking to the resident as if I was not standing there midsentence. I had been going through the post-op notes for the patient in bed four, the one with the complicated drain placement, and she cut in with her own assessment before I even finished. The resident looked at me for a second like he was not sure who to listen to, then turned back to her. That was it.

I have been doing handoffs on this floor since before Salwa finished her residency. I know which details the night team needs flagged and which ones can wait. But standing there with my clipboard half-raised, watching everyone pivot to her as if my report was background noise — something about it stayed with me the whole shift. I did not say anything. Just waited until she finished and picked up where I left off like nothing happened.

**Nudge:** "What kept you from interrupting her back?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-11

Still thinking about the supply request from last week. I put in an order for the new wound-care kits on Tuesday — the ones the infection control committee recommended after the audit. I filled out the procurement form, got the unit manager to countersign, followed up with central supply the next morning. Everything by the book. And then nothing. Three days, no confirmation, no rejection, just silence.

I called down to procurement this afternoon and the clerk told me the order was "pending review" by the hospital purchasing coordinator. She could not tell me when it would move forward. Said I should "check back in a few days." So I am sitting here with patients who need updated dressings and I cannot do anything except wait for someone in an office I have never visited to decide whether my clinical judgment warrants a purchase order.

This is the part of the job that nobody sees. I can manage a twelve-bed unit, keep families informed, catch medication errors before they reach the patient, but I cannot get wound-care supplies without begging a clerk to push a form through. The dependency is what gets to me. I did everything right and I still have no control over the outcome. If it were up to me, charge nurses would have direct procurement authority for anything under five hundred dinars. But it is not up to me.

**Nudge:** "What does that waiting feel like?"

**Response:** Like I am back to being a junior nurse asking permission to change a dressing. Twenty-eight years and I still have to stand in line behind someone who has never set foot on a ward. It is not about the kits really. It is about the fact that the hospital has structured things so that someone with my experience has no more say than a fresh graduate when it comes to getting what my patients need. That is the part that sits in my chest.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-15

Normal Friday. Did a double check on all the discharge paperwork before the weekend rush, caught a missing signature on one of the forms that would have bounced back from records. The new nurse, Hana, asked me to walk her through the IV pump calibration again. I do not mind showing people things but she has asked three times now and at some point you have to just do it yourself.

Had mansaf at my sister's house in the evening. My brother-in-law was going on about his new car, the leather seats, the financing deal he negotiated. I ate, nodded, helped clear the table. It was fine. Quiet drive home, listened to the news. Nothing remarkable about any of it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-22

The new infection control policy came down from administration today. They want us to change the way we do central line dressings — different kit, different sequence, different documentation. I have been doing central line care for over two decades. I wrote the current protocol for this unit. And the committee that rewrote it did not consult a single bedside nurse. Not one.

I brought it up in the staff meeting. Said the current approach has kept our infection rates below the hospital average for three years running. Dr. Fares — on staff for maybe eighteen months — pushed back hard, said the new evidence was clear and we needed to "get on board." The unit manager sided with him, of course, he has the letters after his name. So we are switching. I said fine. But I know what works on this floor. I gave in because fighting it further would have made me look like the old guard resisting change, which is exactly the label they want to stick on me.

**Nudge:** "What would have happened if you had kept pushing?"

**Response:** They would have overruled me anyway and I would have looked like I cannot adapt. At least this way I went along on my own terms. If the infection rates go up in the next quarter, the numbers will speak for themselves. That is my leverage. Not the meeting room.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-22

Second entry today because this is still eating at me. After the meeting, the unit manager pulled me aside and asked if I could "mentor" two of the newer nurses on the updated dressing protocol. As if I need to be managed into compliance. As if twenty-some years of keeping this floor running are not proof enough that I know how to implement a procedure.

She said it casually, like it was a compliment — "you're the most experienced, they'll learn best from you." But I heard what she was really saying. She was checking whether I would fall in line. Whether I would carry the new policy to the team or quietly undermine it. The fact that she felt the need to have that conversation at all tells me something about where I stand. My track record should speak for itself. It used to.

**Nudge:** "Could it have just been a compliment?"

**Response:** Maybe. But you learn to read the room after this many years. When someone has already decided to override your judgment, asking you to teach their decision to others is not a compliment — it is containment. And the worst part is I will do it. I will teach Hana and the others exactly how the new protocol works, and I will do it well, because that is what I do. But I will know what it cost me to smile through it.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-28

Long shift, short-staffed again. Covered the floor mostly solo after lunch when Rami called in sick. Made it through, patients are stable, paperwork is done. Going to sit on the balcony with tea and not think about the hospital for a few hours.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-06

Neighborhood council meeting tonight and Abu Fadi talked over me three times while I was presenting the building maintenance budget. Three times. Everyone just sat there. I chair this council and the man cannot let me finish a sentence about a pipe repair without jumping in with his own opinion about which plumber to call.

**Nudge:** "You're the chair — what stopped you from shutting that down?"

**Response:** Because if I come down hard on him he will rally the older residents against me. Abu Fadi has lived in this building since before I moved in. He thinks seniority in the building means seniority on the council. It does not, but half the neighbors see it his way. So I let him talk and then I steer the vote. It works but it should not be necessary.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-10

Had to request time off for my daughter's university orientation next month and the process was humiliating. I submitted the form three weeks in advance, well within policy. The scheduling coordinator — a woman who has been in the role for maybe a year — told me she would "try to accommodate" the request but could not guarantee it because of staffing levels. Try to accommodate. As if I am asking for a favor and not exercising a benefit I have earned.

I asked her to check the seniority list. I have more years on this unit than anyone currently on staff. My requests should be prioritized accordingly. She said the new scheduling system does not weight seniority the way the old one did, that it is "needs-based" now. So a nurse with two years of experience and no dependents has the same standing as me when it comes to getting a day off. I asked to speak with the nursing director and was told she would "follow up by email."

I am not someone who makes a scene. I thanked the coordinator, walked out, went back to my patients. But I spent the rest of the shift turning it over. Thirty years I have given this hospital. I have trained half the people on this floor. And the institution has decided that none of that earns me the simple courtesy of knowing I can attend my daughter's orientation. The system does not recognize what it owes the people who built it.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like if they did recognize it?"

**Response:** It would look like my request being approved without a conversation. It would look like the scheduling coordinator checking my file, seeing twenty-eight years, and saying "done." Not a negotiation. Not a follow-up email. Just the respect that comes from having given most of your working life to one place. That is all I am asking for. It is not complicated.

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-11

Took my mother to her cardiology appointment this morning before my shift. She is doing better — the new medication seems to have stabilized her blood pressure. The cardiologist recognized me from the hospital, called me "brother Tariq" which made my mother smile. She told him I was the best nurse in Jordan, which is not true but I did not correct her.

Stopped at Abu Mahmoud's bakery on the way back for knafeh. My mother insisted on paying even though I had my wallet out. She does that — never lets me cover anything when we are together, says a mother's duty does not expire. I let her. We ate in the car in the hospital parking lot and she told me about a cousin's wedding in Irbid next month. Simple morning. Good morning.

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-12

Quality improvement committee met today and proposed a "shared leadership" model for the nursing units. The idea is to rotate the charge nurse role every quarter so more people "develop leadership skills." They presented it like it was progressive. Like it was about growth. What it actually is, is a way to flatten the hierarchy so that no one person has enough standing to push back on administrative decisions.

I said my piece. Told them continuity matters, that patients benefit from a consistent leader who knows every case on the floor, that rotating the role creates gaps. Dr. Fares jumped in again — this seems to be his hobby now — and talked about "distributed expertise" and "empowering the whole team." The committee chair nodded along. I could feel the room shifting. I said I would review the proposal and provide written feedback, which is my way of not surrendering while buying time. But I know how this goes. They have already decided. They want my title without wanting to say they are taking it.

**Nudge:** "What happens to you if this goes through?"
