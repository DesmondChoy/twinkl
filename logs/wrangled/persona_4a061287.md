## Entry 0 - 2025-07-11

My mother called to remind me about the novena for Tía Carmen's anniversary next week. Didn't need the reminder — it's been circled on my calendar since January. When I was small I used to think these gatherings were just adults talking over coffee, but now I understand them differently. Nine nights of prayer, nine nights of family filling up the house. There's something steady about it.

I taught my third graders how to fold paper flowers today for the altar at school. One little boy asked why we do it every year and I told him the same thing my grandmother told me: because the dead don't really leave if we keep making space for them. He seemed satisfied with that. Sometimes children accept what adults forget — that repetition isn't emptiness, it's a choice to keep something alive.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-11

Carlos asked to meet my family this weekend. I made up something about it being a busy week with the novena. He looked hurt. I feel like I'm lying to two worlds at once — telling him we just need more time, telling my mother I'm too focused on work to date. Neither story is true. The true story is that I don't know how to bring a divorced man into a family that still whispers about my cousin's civil ceremony.

**Nudge:** "What would happen if you just told your mother the truth?"

**Response:** She wouldn't yell. That's not how she operates. She'd get quiet and then start asking gentle questions that feel like tiny knives — How long has this been going on? Has he been to confession? What does his family think about all this? And I'd have no good answers. I don't even know if I want to marry him. I just want space to figure that out without the weight of everyone's expectations pressing down on me before I've made up my own mind.

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-17

Spent the evening at Abuela's preparing food for tomorrow's final night of the novena. Chopped onions until my eyes burned. My cousin Daniela brought her new baby and everyone passed him around the kitchen like a small warm blessing. The prayers start at seven. I'll be there early to set up chairs like I have been every year since I was fourteen.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-22

The new principal at school announced we're "modernizing" the curriculum. Tablets for third graders. Interactive lessons instead of textbooks. She presented it like everyone should be excited but I sat in that meeting thinking about Sister Magdalena who taught at this school for forty years and how her chalkboard handwriting was so beautiful my mother still talks about it. I'm not against technology — I use my phone constantly, I'm not a dinosaur — but something about the way the principal said "we need to move past old methods" made me want to dig my heels in.

After the meeting Roberto from fifth grade asked what I thought and I said it sounded fine. I don't know why I didn't say what I was really thinking. Maybe because I didn't want to be the young teacher defending old ways. Maybe because I don't even know if I'm right. The kids might love the tablets. Sister Magdalena isn't here to ask.

I keep thinking about how my mother taught me to read with a book of saints' stories, turning actual pages, her finger tracing the words. What gets lost when everything becomes a screen? Or am I just afraid of change and calling it something nicer?

**Nudge:** "You said you didn't speak up. What would you have said if you had?"

**Response:** That maybe we should pilot it in one classroom first instead of rolling it out everywhere at once. That the older teachers who've been here for decades deserve to have their methods respected, not treated like problems to be solved. That learning isn't just information transfer — it's also ritual, routine, the physical feeling of a pencil in your hand. But standing up in a staff meeting to say "I think ritual matters" sounds ridiculous. So I stayed quiet and now I'm typing it into my phone at 11pm instead.

My friend Valentina says I'm "too attached to the past." She means it gently but it still stings. She left Guadalajara for Monterrey and barely comes back for holidays now. Good for her. I'm not running from anything by staying. This is where I'm needed. My grandmother is eighty-three. My students know me. The roots here are mine.

**Nudge:** "What about her comment bothered you most?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-02

Carlos and I had a real fight. Not yelling — we don't do that — but the cold kind where you both know something broke. He asked if I was ashamed of him and I didn't answer fast enough. I'm not ashamed. I'm scared. There's a difference but I couldn't find the words to explain it while he was standing there looking at me like he'd already made up his mind about what my silence meant.

My parents have been married for thirty-two years. They met at church, got engaged with my grandfather's blessing, had the wedding everyone still talks about. That's the script. I don't know how to write a different one and still feel like myself. Carlos doesn't fit the script but neither does walking away from him. I lay awake until three trying to figure out which betrayal I could live with.

**Nudge:** "Is there a version of this where nobody gets betrayed?"

**Response:** I want to say yes. The optimistic answer is that my family loves me and they'll accept whoever makes me happy. My cousin got pushback about her civil ceremony and now everyone's fine at Christmas dinner. But I know my mother. She carries things quietly for years. She'd show up to the wedding and smile and then I'd catch her crying in the kitchen when she thinks no one's looking. I don't know if I can build a life on top of that image. Maybe that's my problem — I'm not choosing between Carlos and my family. I'm choosing between the version of me who disappoints people and the version who disappears herself to keep everyone comfortable.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-09

Went to confession today for the first time in months. Didn't plan to — I was walking past the church after buying bread and the door was open. Father Miguel has known me since my first communion so there was no hiding behind anonymity. I told him I've been lying to my mother about something important. He didn't ask what. Just waited.

I ended up talking for twenty minutes about Carlos, about feeling stuck, about how the rules I grew up with don't seem to have instructions for this situation. He said something I keep turning over: "The tradition doesn't ask you to stop living. It asks you to bring your life to it honestly." I don't know exactly what that means yet but it felt like permission to stop pretending there's a perfect answer.

After confession I sat in the pew where my grandmother always sits and just breathed. The church smelled the same way it did when I was seven. Some things don't change and today that felt like comfort instead of a cage.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-13

School starts back next week. Spent the afternoon organizing my classroom. Put up the same San Francisco de Asis poster my mother gave me my first year teaching. The corners are getting worn. Considered replacing it but decided against it. Some things are allowed to show their age.

## Entry 8 - 2025-08-19

I told my mother about Carlos. Not everything — not the divorce — but that I've been seeing someone. She asked when she could meet him and I panicked and said "soon" which is what I always say. She knows me too well. She could hear the hesitation and asked what I wasn't telling her.

I almost said it. The words were right there. But then my abuela came into the room asking about dinner and the moment passed and I felt relief and shame in equal measure. Relief because I got more time. Shame because I'm a grown woman hiding in the kitchen of my childhood home, still arranging my life around moments that are safe.

Carlos deserves better than being my secret. I deserve better than feeling like a coward. Something has to break.

**Nudge:** "What would breaking look like for you?"

**Response:** Telling the full truth and accepting whatever comes after. Not performing okay-ness at the next family gathering. Letting my mother feel her feelings without me trying to manage them. Maybe it looks like a difficult Sunday dinner where Carlos sits across from my father and answers questions about his first marriage. Maybe it looks like my grandmother going quiet in that way she does when she disapproves. I can survive that. I've survived other hard things. What I can't survive is another six months of living in two separate worlds that never touch.

## Entry 9 - 2025-08-24

Brought Carlos to Sunday lunch at my parents' house. My hands were shaking when we walked through the door. My mother had set an extra place — she knew I wouldn't come alone after our last conversation. She's always known more than she lets on.

It wasn't easy. There were silences that stretched too long and my father asked pointed questions about where Carlos sees himself in five years. But my grandmother held his hand when he talked about his daughter from his first marriage, and said children are always a blessing no matter the circumstances. That's not the same as approval but it's not rejection either.

After dessert, while Carlos helped my father clear plates, my mother pulled me aside and said "I don't understand all of it but I can see he's good to you." That's enough for now. Maybe that's what Father Miguel meant — bringing my life to the tradition honestly doesn't mean it fits perfectly. It just means I stop hiding the pieces that don't.
