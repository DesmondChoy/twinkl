Yet something in her has always craved the unfamiliar—she spent two years teaching abroad in Malaysia right after university, a decision that horrified her parents but made her feel truly alive. Now back home with a permanent teaching position, she finds herself caught between the comfort of her steady salary and pension, and the restless itch to do something unexpected before her thirties slip away. She saves meticulously but dreams wildly.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-26

Winter break finally started and I should be relieved. Instead I feel this strange hollowness. My cousin Rania announced her engagement yesterday at the family gathering—everyone was so happy, talking about wedding dates and apartments and furniture. I smiled and hugged her but inside I was somewhere else entirely.

I keep thinking about that email from my old friend Amir. He's starting an educational nonprofit in Morocco and asked if I'd consider joining for six months. Six months. The thought makes my chest tight in two directions—terrified of leaving my position, my apartment, my carefully built routine. But also something like hunger.

My mother would never understand. She still talks about how "irresponsible" Malaysia was. But I was 24 then. I'm 29 now. At what point do I stop blaming responsibility for my fear and fear for my responsibility?

**Nudge:** "What would you actually lose?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-28

Spent the morning organizing my savings spreadsheet. I have enough for eight months of expenses if something goes wrong. That number used to make me feel safe. Today it just felt like a number. Had coffee with my sister. She mentioned a colleague looking for a roommate, assuming I might want to save on rent. Didn't correct her assumption.

**Nudge:** "What changed about that number?"

**Response:** I think I realized I've been saving for an emergency that might never come. Or maybe saving so I'd have an excuse not to take risks. "Can't leave, I'm building my safety net." But the net is built. So now what?

## Entry 2 - 2026-01-02

First day back at school. Taught the same Nizar Qabbani poems I've taught for four years. The students were half-asleep. I was fully awake but pretending otherwise. Emailed Amir back asking for more details. Just details. Not committing to anything. Put my phone in my desk drawer so I wouldn't check it every five minutes.

**Nudge:** "What are you hoping the details will tell you?"

**Response:** Whether I can do this without burning everything down. I want to know if there's a version of this where I don't have to choose between feeling alive and feeling safe. Probably there isn't. But I need the details to prove that to myself.
