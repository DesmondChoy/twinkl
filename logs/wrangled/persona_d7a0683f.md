## Entry 0 - 2025-12-31

New Year's Eve and I'm sitting at Erik's kitchen table while everyone else is in the living room watching some countdown special. His uncle was here earlier, going off about how the city council's new housing plan for asylum seekers is going to "ruin the neighbourhood." Nobody said anything. I didn't say anything. Erik kind of half-laughed and changed the subject to football.

I've met some of the families that housing plan is for. I know their names. I know Fatima's daughter just started school and is terrified of the cafeteria. And I just sat there holding my drink and let this man talk about them like they were a problem to be managed. I kept telling myself it wasn't the right moment, it's a party, don't make it weird. But that's just an excuse.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you more - the setting or something else?"

**Response:** Scared I'd lose my temper and they'd just dismiss me.

## Entry 1 - 2026-01-04

Spent the morning at Akademibokhandeln buying a new notebook for the semester and ended up at the Espresso House on Svartbäcksgatan after. I ordered a coffee and one of those wrapped sandwiches and then just stared at the packaging. Plastic wrap, plastic tray, a paper sleeve that probably isn't even recyclable. I've been reading about single-use packaging policy for my thesis for months. I know the numbers. I know what this stuff does. And I bought it anyway because I was hungry and didn't feel like walking home first.

It sounds ridiculous to feel bad about a sandwich wrapper. People would laugh. But it's the pattern that bugs me. I write about systemic failures in environmental policy and then I make the lazy choice when it's my own lunch. The gap between what I study and how I actually live keeps showing up in these small ways. I don't buy fast fashion anymore, I cycle, I eat less meat than I used to. But then there's this sandwich in a plastic coffin and I think, what's the point of any of it if I can't even get the small stuff right.

My housemate Nils would say I'm overthinking it. He'd say one sandwich wrapper doesn't matter. And he'd be technically correct. But I think the willingness to say "it doesn't matter" about any single thing is exactly how you end up not caring about anything.

**Nudge:** "Do you actually believe one sandwich wrapper matters, or is it about something bigger?"

**Response:** It's about whether I'm becoming someone who just talks.

Overheard Markus in the department kitchen making a joke about a Somali student's accent during a presentation. A couple of people laughed. I pretended I was busy with the coffee machine.

## Entry 3 - 2026-01-13

I'm so tired. Thesis crunch plus volunteering Saturdays plus a seminar on EU regulatory frameworks that runs three hours every Tuesday evening. I barely have energy to cook. Today I ordered Foodora twice. Both times it was from chains I know treat their delivery riders badly. I've seen the articles. I've shared the articles. And then I opened the app and ordered anyway because I couldn't face making pasta.

It's not that I forgot. I just didn't care enough in the moment. Or I cared but my tiredness won. I don't know which is worse. The riders are out there in January cold on bikes so I don't have to walk to my own kitchen. I can dress it up however I want but that's what happened.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-16

Had a supervision meeting with Professor Lindqvist today. She liked my chapter draft on enforcement gaps but said I need to address the "political feasibility" section more carefully. Fair enough. But then she casually mentioned that the department is being courted by Vattenfall for a research partnership and asked if I'd be interested in being a student liaison. Good for my CV, she said. Good connections.

Vattenfall is state-owned and technically pivoting toward renewables, but they also ran lignite mines in Germany for decades and their track record on indigenous Sámi land rights in the north is awful. I know this because I wrote a case study on it last year. Lindqvist knows I wrote it. She was my supervisor for that paper.

I should have said no on the spot. Instead I said I'd think about it. Because part of me is thinking about what it would look like on a job application. Part of me is doing the math on whether working with them from the inside might actually lead to something useful. And I hate that I'm even calculating like this, because I know that's how everyone justifies it. "Change from within." It's the oldest excuse in the book and I've heard it a hundred times from people I don't respect. But here I am, considering it for myself, because Professor Lindqvist smiled when she said my name and I liked being chosen.

**Nudge:** "What bothers you more - the partnership or that you liked being asked?"

**Response:** Both. But mostly the second one.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-16

Still thinking about the Vattenfall thing from this morning. Went for a walk along the river after dinner to try to sort it out and I'm not sure I managed. The thing is, I talk a lot about how corporations co-opt well-meaning people. I literally have a slide in my thesis presentation about it. "Institutional capture of reform narratives." That's my phrase. And now I'm being offered a small taste of exactly that.

Convenience is the word I keep coming back to. It would be convenient for my career. It would be convenient to tell myself I'm doing it for the right reasons. It would be convenient to let Professor Lindqvist handle the ethical questions while I just show up and take notes and put Vattenfall on my LinkedIn. That's what most people would do. That's what a practical person would do.

But I keep thinking about Fatima and her daughter from the refugee centre, and the Sámi reindeer herders whose grazing land got destroyed for a mine that Vattenfall then sold off when it became unprofitable. These are not abstract policy questions to me. Or at least they shouldn't be. If I take this liaison position, I become someone who files those things under "complicated" and moves on. And I've always told myself I wouldn't be that person. I just didn't expect the test to come from my own supervisor.

**Nudge:** "Have you decided, or are you still hoping you won't have to?"

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-23

I told Lindqvist I'd pass on the Vattenfall liaison position. She took it well enough, said she understood, moved on to thesis feedback. I don't think she was surprised.

At the volunteer session on Saturday, one of the newer volunteers, a guy named Anders, made a comment about how some of the refugee families "don't even try to learn Swedish." He said it lightly, like it was just an observation. Two other volunteers nodded. I know for a fact that three of the families he's talking about attend SFI classes four mornings a week. One of the mothers, Amira, practices Swedish vocabulary with her kids at the kitchen table every evening. I've seen her notebook.

I didn't correct him. I thought about it. I opened my mouth and then just said something about how the language courses have long waiting lists, which is true but wasn't really the point. The point was that he was wrong and I sidestepped it instead of saying so directly. I keep doing this thing where I provide context instead of actually challenging what someone says. It feels diplomatic in the moment but afterward it just feels like cowardice dressed up as nuance.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-28

Quiet week. Spent most of it in the library working through policy documents for chapter four. The snow has been heavy and cycling has been miserable but the bus is worse, so I keep at it. Had fika with Nils and our other housemate Sara on Wednesday. We talked about summer plans. Nils wants to do a hiking trip in Norway. Sara is going home to Malmö.

Cooked a big pot of lentil soup on Sunday that I've been eating all week. My mum called to check in, asked about the thesis timeline. I told her it's on track for June submission. She sounded relieved. Nothing eventful really. Just the steady rhythm of getting through January.

## Entry 8 - 2026-02-02

Thesis stress is properly hitting now. I was up until two in the morning reading IPCC reports and cross-referencing enforcement data and at some point I just stopped and looked at what I was doing. I'm writing about policy mechanisms that might reduce emissions by some fraction of a percentage point over a decade. And meanwhile the numbers keep getting worse. Every single year. I read a paper last week that said we've already locked in enough warming to make certain Pacific islands uninhabitable. Already locked in. Past tense.

So what am I actually doing. I'm sitting in a well-heated Swedish apartment writing about governance frameworks while people are losing their homes to rising seas right now. My thesis will get graded, filed, maybe cited in another thesis. The policy recommendations I'm writing will be read by my supervisor and two examiners and then forgotten. That's the honest truth of it.

I could have gone into something more direct. Field work. Activism. Legal advocacy. Instead I chose the comfortable academic route where I get to feel smart about the problem without ever getting my hands dirty. My friend Elsa works for an NGO in Bangladesh building flood shelters. She makes a third of what I'll make when I graduate. She's also actually doing something. I chose to write about the problem from a distance because it's safer and it counts toward a degree. That's the choice I made today and every day I sit in that library.

**Nudge:** "Is the thesis actually the problem, or is it that you're not sure it's enough?"

**Response:** I don't know. I'm too tired to answer that honestly right now.

## Entry 9 - 2026-02-02

Came back to write more after lying in bed for an hour not sleeping. There was a moment at the volunteer centre last week where someone asked me to help draft a complaint letter about housing conditions and I said I was too busy with my thesis. I wasn't too busy. I just didn't want to take it on.

**Nudge:** "What made you not want to take it on?"

**Response:** Honestly? I just didn't want another thing to carry.

## Entry 10 - 2026-02-08

I've been thinking about something all week. On Tuesday I went to the supermarket and I was standing in front of the coffee shelf trying to decide between the Fairtrade one that costs almost double and the store brand. I always buy the Fairtrade one. It's one of those small choices I make that lets me tell myself I'm someone who pays attention. But this time I picked up the store brand and put it in my basket. I was over budget for the month and I just thought, I can't afford to care about this right now. And then I stood there for a solid minute feeling sick about a bag of coffee.

It's the same pattern from the sandwich wrapper in January. These tiny consumer decisions that I load with all this meaning. But maybe the meaning is real. If I stop caring about the coffee, do I stop caring about the next thing, and the thing after that. At what point does "I can't afford it right now" become a permanent excuse. I watched my dad do this over years. He used to be involved with Greenpeace, went to protests, the whole thing. Now he drives an SUV and says the protests don't accomplish anything anymore. He didn't change overnight. It was a thousand small surrenders.

I don't want that to be me. But I also bought the cheap coffee. And I drank it this morning and it tasted fine and I didn't think about it until now. That's the part that scares me. How quickly the guilt fades. How easily convenience becomes the default. I keep writing in this thing like that's going to help, but I'm not sure documenting my failures counts as doing something about them.
