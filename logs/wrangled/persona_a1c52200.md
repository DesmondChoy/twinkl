# Persona a1c52200: Nadia Al-Rashid

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** a1c52200
- **Name:** Nadia Al-Rashid
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Teacher
- **Culture:** Middle Eastern
- **Core Values:** Hedonism
- **Bio:** Nadia teaches high school literature in Amman and has cultivated her apartment into a sensory haven with thick rugs, fragrant coffee always brewing, and afternoon light that pools on her reading corner. She turned down a department head position three years ago because it would have meant staying late every evening and giving up her Thursday souk visits. Her colleagues sometimes call her "the relaxed one," which she takes as a compliment even when it's not meant as one.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

My students turned in their essays on Taha Hussein today. Most of them are struggling with the language, but Layla wrote something that made me stop grading. She said his blindness made him see more clearly, that losing one sense opened the others. I sat with that for a while after school, drinking mint tea on my balcony as the call to prayer drifted up from the neighborhood mosque.

I think I understand what she meant. When I stopped chasing the next promotion, the next credential, everything else came into sharper focus. The weight of the teacup in my hands. The specific shade of orange the sunset throws on the building across the street. These aren't consolation prizes for not advancing. They're the whole point.

My sister called later and asked if I'm still "just teaching" the same classes. I said yes. She doesn't understand why I'm not bored. I didn't try to explain that I'm not looking for excitement from my job. That's not what jobs are for.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

The school administration announced today that we're switching to a new standardized testing system. Six meetings this month. Saturday workshops through January. Mandatory curriculum alignment sessions.

I felt my stomach drop when I read the email. Not because the work is hard. Because I know exactly what this means. No more lingering over coffee in the morning because I'll need to leave earlier for meetings. No more Thursday evenings at the souk because Saturdays will be consumed by training. No more space in my day for the small things that make it bearable.

My colleague Tariq seems energized by it. He was talking about "opportunities for growth" and "showcasing our department." I just nodded. I wanted to ask him when he last sat somewhere doing nothing and felt content. When he last ate a meal slowly enough to taste it.

I know this sounds dramatic. It's just meetings. It's just one semester. But that's how it always starts. First it's one semester, then it's a "new normal," and before you know it you've forgotten what it felt like to have time that belongs to you.

Mama would say I should be grateful to have a job at all. She's right, probably. But gratitude and resentment can live in the same body.

**Nudge:** "What would you lose if you pushed back?"

**Response:** Everything and nothing. I'd lose standing with the administration. I'd be labeled as difficult, uncooperative. Eventually it would affect my references if I ever wanted to move.

But what I'd really lose is the illusion that I can have it both ways. That I can care about my peace and also be a "team player" in a system that treats peace as laziness. Right now I'm invisible, which means I'm safe. If I push back, I become visible in the wrong way.

The truth is I probably won't say anything. I'll go to the meetings and protect what I can and hope it blows over. I'm not proud of this. But I also know that martyrdom doesn't taste good.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-18

Second Saturday workshop done. Made foul for breakfast beforehand. Good olive oil makes a difference, even at 6am. Workshop was tedious but I sat near the window where the light was warm. Found a new bakery on the way home. Their knafeh has the right amount of orange blossom.

Sometimes survival is about noticing what's still good.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-25

Christmas isn't our holiday but the city has lights everywhere and I love them anyway. Walking home tonight the whole street was glowing, gold and white, and I stopped to just look. A shopkeeper came out to smoke and we stood there together not saying anything, just watching. He offered me a sesame cookie from a paper bag. Still warm.

This is what I mean when I say the good things aren't complicated. Lights on a cold street. A cookie from a stranger. The permission to pause.

My students are gone for break and I have two weeks with nothing required of me. I've planned nothing. That's the plan. Maybe I'll sleep late and read novels and take long baths and visit my aunt who makes the best maqluba. Or maybe I'll do something else entirely. The point is I don't know yet, and not knowing feels like freedom.

**Nudge:** "What does that freedom feel like?"

**Response:** Like finally exhaling. Like my body relaxes in ways I didn't know it was tense. When there's nothing scheduled, time moves differently. An hour feels like an hour instead of like sixty minutes I'm supposed to fill with something productive.

I think most people are so used to planned time that they've forgotten the other kind exists. They schedule their relaxation, which turns it into another task. "Self-care Sunday" as an obligation. But real rest doesn't have a hashtag. It's what happens when you stop trying to optimize anything.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-03

Back to school. The break ended too quickly, as they always do. Woke up this morning before my alarm and lay there feeling the weight of the semester ahead.

Three more Saturday workshops scheduled. Parent conferences starting next week. A new student in my advanced class who apparently has "behavioral issues" which is usually code for "nobody took time to understand him."

I made myself the fancy coffee, the Ethiopian beans I save for hard mornings. It helped a little. But even the coffee felt rushed. I was drinking it to finish it, not to enjoy it.

This is what I'm afraid of. That the system will eventually win not by forcing me to change but by leaving me no room to be who I am. That I'll adapt and adapt until I can't remember what I was adapting away from.

Dramatic again, I know. It's just the first day talking. By next week I'll have found my rhythm. I always do.

**Nudge:** "Who were you before you started adapting?"

**Response:** Someone with more time, probably. That's the easy answer.

The harder answer is I'm not sure I was anyone different. Maybe I've always been negotiating between what I want and what's required. Even as a child I remember preferring slow afternoons to busy schedules, choosing books over activities that might have "developed my potential."

Maybe the question isn't who I was but whether there's a version of me that wouldn't have to fight for this. Someone who naturally craves what the world rewards. That person doesn't exist, though. So here I am.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-12

Something shifted this week. Not in my circumstances, but in how I'm holding them.

I've started bringing my good tea to school. The loose-leaf oolong that I usually save for weekends. I keep it in a small tin in my desk drawer and brew it during my free period. The ritual takes five minutes that I technically don't have, but those five minutes change the texture of the entire day.

My colleague Hana noticed and asked where I got the tea. We ended up talking about her grandmother who used to make her own herb blends. Now Hana brings me a cup of her za'atar tea on Tuesdays, and I share my oolong on Thursdays. It's become a small island of niceness in the week.

I think I'd been treating my work life and my real life as separate territories, with work as enemy land where beauty couldn't survive. But that's not true. Beauty is portable. You can carry it with you if you're willing to make room for it.

The Saturday workshops are still tedious. The new testing system is still pointless. But I'm finding cracks where something good can grow.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-21

My brother visited this weekend. He's an engineer in Dubai now, making good money, working long hours. He looks tired but won't admit it.

Over dinner he asked when I'm "going to do something" with my career. I said I'm doing something with it. I teach. He said I know what he means. Higher positions. More responsibility. A path that leads somewhere.

I told him my path leads to my apartment every evening in time to cook dinner and read before bed. He laughed like I was joking. When he realized I wasn't, he got that look. The look that says he's worried about me.

I hate that look. Like contentment is a symptom of something wrong. Like a woman my age without ambition must be hiding some failure or fear.

Maybe I am afraid. Afraid of waking up exhausted every day like he does. Afraid of forgetting what rest feels like. If that's fear, I'm not ashamed of it.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for you to stop explaining yourself?"

**Response:** Honestly? I think I'd have to stop caring what they think. Which sounds simple but isn't.

Their opinions shouldn't matter. I'm nearly forty. I pay my own bills. I've built a life that works for me. But family has this way of making you feel like a child again. My brother's concern isn't really concern, it's disappointment that I'm not living the way he thinks I should. And despite everything, part of me still wants his approval.

The exhausting thing is that he'll never understand. He measures life by achievements. I measure it by how it feels to live it. We're speaking different languages.

Maybe the answer is just to stop having the conversation. Nod and change the subject. Let him think whatever he thinks. Save my energy for people who don't need me to be different.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-31

Made mansaf from scratch today. It took hours. The lamb, the jameed sauce, all of it. My apartment smells incredible. I ate slowly, standing at the kitchen window watching the rain.

Nobody saw it. Nobody will praise me for it. It's not an accomplishment by any measure that matters to the world. But my god, it was good. The texture, the warmth, the satisfaction of having made something beautiful for no reason except that I wanted to.

This is what I protect.

## Entry 8 - 2026-02-08

Bad week. Three students failing my class because they don't do the reading. Administration pressure to raise pass rates. A parent screamed at me over email for being "too demanding" when I wouldn't accept a late assignment that was two weeks overdue.

I came home Thursday wanting to cry. Made myself do it anyway, just sat on the couch and let it happen. Then I took a bath with the expensive salts I've been saving and drank wine that was probably too good for a weeknight.

The world tells me I should fix these problems. Work harder, communicate better, be more flexible. But some problems aren't mine to fix. The student who doesn't read won't start reading because I exhaust myself trying to convince him. The parent who yells will keep yelling regardless of my response.

What I can control is the bath and the wine and the permission to feel bad without trying to optimize my way out of it.

**Nudge:** "What did letting yourself cry change?"

**Response:** It reminded me that I'm human. That sounds simple but I forget sometimes. In teacher mode I'm supposed to be endlessly patient, endlessly resourceful. There's no room for frustration that isn't immediately converted into a lesson plan improvement.

Crying let me feel the weight of the week without doing anything about it. And then it passed. The bath wasn't medicine for the crying. The crying was already the medicine. The bath was just dessert.

I think we're taught that negative emotions are problems to solve rather than experiences to have. But sometimes you just need to be sad for a while. It doesn't mean anything is wrong. It means you're paying attention.

## Entry 9 - 2026-02-14

Valentine's Day. I'm not with anyone and haven't been for a while. Most years this is fine. Today I felt the absence more than usual.

Not loneliness exactly. More like awareness that my life lacks certain kinds of warmth that come from partnership. Shared meals across a table. Someone who knows what kind of day you had without you having to explain. Inside jokes.

I walked to the old bookshop after school, the one with the narrow aisles and the owner who always recommends obscure poets. He gave me coffee and we talked about Mahmoud Darwish for half an hour. On the way home I stopped for the good pastries, the ones with rose petals pressed into the glaze.

I think there's a version of this day that would have been sad. Lonely woman, empty apartment, commercial holiday. But that's not how it felt. It felt like choosing, again, to make my own day good. To not wait for someone else to bring me flowers when I can bring myself pastries.

Mama called to ask if I was okay. I told her I'd had a lovely day. She didn't believe me, but it was true.

I know I write a lot about small pleasures. Someone reading this might think I'm avoiding the big questions. But I think the small pleasures are the big questions, answered. What do you want from life? This. A warm cup, a good book, a body that's been cared for, time that belongs to me.

Tomorrow will be another staff meeting, another round of tedious requirements. But tonight is mine. And that's enough.
