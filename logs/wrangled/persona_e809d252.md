Look, I know some teachers think the community garden visits are a waste of instructional time. We spent two hours there today and yes, that's time away from test prep. But watching Marcus Jr. (not named after me, just a coincidence) actually engage with something for the first time all year? Seeing him carefully transplant seedlings and ask questions about composting? That matters.

Mrs. Patterson made a comment in the break room about my "field trip habit" but I'm not going to apologize for it. These kids need to understand they're part of something bigger than standardized tests. They need to touch the dirt, see the earthworms, understand where food actually comes from. That's education too.

## Entry 1 - 2025-01-14

Didn't call Grandma back again. She left another voicemail about the restaurant anniversary dinner planning and I just... let it go to voicemail. I'll call her tomorrow.

**Nudge:** "What made you hesitate to pick up?"

**Response:** Honestly, I know she's going to ask me to give a speech at the 60th anniversary dinner. In Cantonese. My Cantonese is terrible and I keep meaning to practice but I never do. It feels like I'm letting her down every time we talk and she hears how rusty I've gotten.

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-16

Principal wants me to use the new standardized curriculum materials for social studies. They come from the district. They're fine, technically. Cover all the state requirements.

But they're so sanitized. The unit on immigration literally has two paragraphs on the Chinese Exclusion Act. Two paragraphs. My great-grandfather couldn't enter this country for decades because of that law. I told the principal I'd supplement with additional materials. She said to be careful about "going off curriculum." Said it in that way that means don't.

**Nudge:** "So what will you do with those materials?"

**Response:** I'm going to use the curriculum. But I'm also going to bring in my family photos and tell the real story during the personal narrative unit. They can't tell me I can't share my own family history. At least I don't think they can.

## Entry 3 - 2025-01-17

The kids blew my mind today. We were talking about the water cycle and Jordan raised her hand and asked if the water we drink is the same water dinosaurs drank and I said yes, basically, and then she asked if that meant we were connected to dinosaurs and I said yes again and she got this look on her face like something clicked.

Then Carlos said if we're connected to dinosaurs through water we must be connected to each other too and to the fish and to the trees and I just stood there for a second because yes, exactly, that's exactly it. These ten-year-olds just figured out in five minutes what some adults never understand. We spent the rest of the period talking about interconnection and nobody complained and nobody looked at the clock.

**Nudge:** "What did that moment mean to you?"

**Response:** It reminded me why I do this job. Not for the test scores or the evaluations. For moments like that where kids discover something true about the world. That we're all connected, that what we do matters beyond ourselves. That's what I want them to carry with them.

## Entry 4 - 2025-01-17

Second entry today because I just need to get this out. Went to the grocery store after school, totally normal trip, and I just stood in the produce section for way too long looking at the plastic clamshells of strawberries. They're from Chile. In January. Wrapped in plastic that's going to exist for five hundred years so I can have strawberries in the middle of winter.

I bought them anyway. I bought the stupid strawberries because I was tired and I wanted something sweet and the farmer's market doesn't open until Saturday. And I know one person buying or not buying strawberries doesn't change the global supply chain but I still felt like a hypocrite putting them in my cart.

This is what I mean when I say it's exhausting to care about everything all the time. My students look at me like I have answers but I'm just as stuck as everyone else. I teach them about sustainability and then I buy Chilean strawberries in plastic. I tell them every choice matters and then I make choices that don't align with that. I don't know how to live in this world without constantly feeling like I'm failing at something.

Called Grandma. We talked for forty minutes. I'm going to give the speech at the anniversary dinner. In Cantonese. She's going to help me practice.

**Nudge:** "How do you feel about that decision?"

**Response:** Nervous but good. It's important to her. The restaurant is important to the whole family, to the community really. Dad worked there every summer through high school. So did I. People need to hear what it means to us, in the language it's always been spoken in.

## Entry 6 - 2025-01-29

The diversity assembly actually worked! I've been pushing for this for two years and today we had speakers from five different community organizations talking to the whole school. Mrs. Okonkwo from the Nigerian cultural center, Mr. Patel from the Hindu temple, someone from the tribal council, and two others.

The kids were so engaged. They asked real questions. One of my students asked Mrs. Okonkwo what she missed most about Nigeria and she started crying a little and then laughed and said "the food, always the food" and everyone laughed and it was this beautiful human moment. This is what school should feel like. Not test prep and discipline charts. Actual humans connecting with each other, learning that the world is bigger than their own street.

**Nudge:** "What made you push so hard for this?"

**Response:** When I was a kid there was nobody who looked like me in the history books or the assemblies. I remember how alone that felt. I don't want any of my students to feel that way. I want them to see themselves in school, and I want them to see each other too.

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-01

Made dumplings with Mom today for Lunar New Year prep. My hands remember the folding even when my brain forgets the right way to pleat them. She corrected me three times on the same fold and I wanted to be annoyed but honestly I was just grateful she's still here to correct me.

She told me stories about the restaurant again, the early days when Grandpa worked eighteen hour shifts and Grandma handled the front while raising Dad. Stories I've heard a hundred times but they never get old. There's something about flour on your hands and family around you that makes everything feel solid. Like no matter what else is happening in the world, this is real. This is what matters.

## Entry 8 - 2025-02-07

Parent-teacher conferences all day. Twelve families. My voice is gone but one mom thanked me for showing her son that being Chinese-American is something to be proud of. That one sentence made the whole exhausting day worth it.

**Nudge:** "What did it mean to hear that?"

**Response:** More than I can explain. I spent so many years feeling caught between two worlds, not Chinese enough, not American enough. If I can help even one kid skip that confusion, help them feel whole from the start... that's why I became a teacher. That's the whole point.

## Entry 9 - 2025-02-12

Long week. Just long. A lot of grading, a lot of meetings, a lot of everything. The community garden got a small grant from the city though, so that's something. We can finally fix the broken irrigation system and maybe add a few more raised beds for the school partnership program.

Practiced my speech with Grandma over video call. My Cantonese is getting better but still rough. She says the important thing is not perfect pronunciation but speaking from the heart. I'm trying to believe her. The anniversary dinner is in two weeks and I keep rewriting what I want to say.

**Nudge:** "What do you keep changing in the speech?"

**Response:** I keep trying to capture what the restaurant means. Not just to our family but to the town. It's where people celebrated graduations and mourned losses. Where the same families have come for sixty years. It's history. It's proof we belong here. I don't know how to say all that in five minutes, in a language I barely speak, without crying.

## Entry 10 - 2025-02-18

I know I should have stayed for the whole faculty meeting but I had to leave early for the speech practice. Principal noticed. She didn't say anything but I saw her write something down. I'll deal with whatever comes from that.

Some things are more important than faculty meetings about parking lot protocols. The anniversary dinner is this Saturday and my grandmother is counting on me. The whole family is counting on me. And maybe that sounds dramatic but the restaurant isn't just a business, it's proof that we made it here, that we stayed, that we built something. I'm not going to let a faculty meeting come between me and honoring that. I'm just not.
