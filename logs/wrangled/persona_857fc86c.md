Look, the board meeting was fine. I know the numbers weren't where they wanted them to be, but we're not a regular business, we're supposed to actually help people, not just chase profits. They keep saying "sustainability" but they mean money, not the planet or the farmers.

Maybe I should've pushed back harder when they suggested cutting the premiums for the Nilgiri growers. Those families depend on that extra margin. But I didn't want to seem difficult in my first quarter review.

**Nudge:** "what did the board want the numbers to look like?"

**Response:** They wanted 15% growth in volume, but I told them we're already at capacity with our current supplier relationships. Growing that fast would mean either lowering our quality standards or onboarding farms we haven't vetted for labor practices.

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-06

So tired of people who don't see beyond their own bubble. Had lunch with Kavya and she spent the whole time complaining about her Bali trip getting cancelled. Meanwhile I'm reading about the flooding in Bangladesh that displaced 200,000 people.

I didn't say anything because what's the point. She'd probably think I'm being preachy again. Sometimes it feels like nobody around me actually cares that the world is literally drowning.

**Nudge:** "sounds like something was left unsaid with Kavya"

**Response:** It's not about Kavya specifically. Everyone's allowed to have their own problems.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-13

The refugee kids had me make dosas with them in the community kitchen after class. Little Yusuf kept insisting I was doing it wrong, showing me how his mother taught him back in Sri Lanka. He's eight and he's already lived through so much.

Came home and actually felt okay for the first time this week. It's weird how being around them grounds me. They're dealing with real displacement and trauma but they still laugh and tease each other and care about getting the dosa crispy.

**Nudge:** "what made that moment with Yusuf different from the rest of your week?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-16

Spent the morning reviewing applications for the new supplier spot. Found a collective in Wayanad that's run entirely by women, most of them widows of farmers who died by suicide during the debt crisis. Their coffee quality is excellent and their cooperative structure is exactly what we should be supporting.

Brought it to the team meeting. Everyone agreed it was the right choice. Finally feels like we're doing what we're supposed to be doing.

**Nudge:** "what was it like reading those applications?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-16

Just got an email from the board chair. They're "concerned" about the Wayanad decision. Want me to justify why we're taking on a supplier with no export history instead of the established estate in Coorg that approached us.

The Coorg estate uses contract labor with no guaranteed wages. They have documented cases of workers being underpaid. But they're "low-risk" from a business perspective. I hate this.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-16

Called Amma and told her about the board situation. She reminded me that Appa spent fifteen years fighting the same battles in his textile union before he saw any real change. He faced down factory owners who threatened to shut down and leave thousands unemployed if workers demanded safety equipment.

She said the difference between principles and stubbornness is whether you're willing to do the work to prove your case. So I'm doing the work. Spent the last three hours building a risk assessment that shows the Wayanad collective actually has better long-term stability because of their cooperative structure and community investment.

Going to send it tomorrow with a detailed comparison. If the board still pushes back, at least I'll know I tried to do it properly instead of just digging in emotionally. Appa always said that fighting for people means fighting smart, not just fighting loud.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-22

Can't sleep. Keep thinking about the plastic crisis report I read earlier. 13 million tons of plastic flow into the ocean every year. Thirteen million. And here I am organizing beach cleanups that collect maybe 200 kilos on a good day. It's like bailing out the Titanic with a teaspoon.

What's even the point? The corporations keep producing it, governments keep allowing it, and people like me feel good about ourselves for picking up trash on weekends while the actual system keeps churning. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just performing care instead of actually making a difference.

But then what else am I supposed to do? Stop trying? That feels worse. Maybe the trying matters even if the math doesn't add up. I don't know. I really don't know anymore.

**Nudge:** "what would it look like to not keep trying?"

**Response:** Honestly? It would probably look like less exhaustion and more sleep. But also like giving up on the idea that things could be better, and I don't think I know how to do that. My family didn't raise me to just accept things as they are.

## Entry 7 - 2025-02-25

Team meeting turned into an argument about whether we should switch to cheaper packaging to improve margins. I said we should stick with compostable even if it costs more, and Raj accused me of being inflexible and making decisions based on feeling instead of data.

Feeling. Like caring about the planet is some soft emotional indulgence instead of literally the most rational response to a climate emergency. I wanted to scream at him that his "data" conveniently ignores every externality that doesn't show up on a quarterly spreadsheet.

But I didn't. Because that's not how you manage a team professionally, right? So I just sat there and took notes while everyone else talked about cost-per-unit like that's the only thing that matters. This job is making me so tired.

**Nudge:** "what did the notes say?"

**Response:** Things like "research biodegradable alternatives under 2 rupees per unit" and "calculate waste impact comparison." Basically homework to prove that I'm not just being difficult. It's exhausting but it's how you actually win these things.

The Wayanad collective got approved. Board voted in our favor after reviewing the risk assessment. I should feel happy about it but mostly I just feel drained that I had to fight this hard to do the obviously right thing.

Started drafting the partnership agreement and realized we're actually going to change these women's lives. They'll have stable export contracts, fair prices, international market access. That's real. That matters. Why doesn't this feel like enough?

**Nudge:** "why would winning not feel like enough?"

## Entry 9 - 2025-02-27

Barely slept but still showed up for English class with the refugee kids. Yusuf brought his little sister Amara for the first time. She's six and kept hiding behind him, wouldn't say a word the whole hour.

At the end she came up and gave me a drawing of a house with a big tree. Yusuf said it's their house from before. Just a kid drawing but it made me cry on the train ride home.

**Nudge:** "what about the drawing hit you?"

**Response:** Just one of those days where everything feels heavy. The drawing was sweet.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-01

Met with the Wayanad collective over video call to finalize the partnership terms. The women were all crowded around one laptop in their office, talking over each other with questions about shipping and quality control and payment schedules. Their energy was incredible.

The woman leading the collective, Lakshmi, said something that stuck with me. She told me they've been rejected by dozens of buyers who thought they were too risky, too small, too inexperienced. But she never doubted that someone would eventually see the value in what they're building. She said, "We do good work for our community. Eventually someone who cares about that has to notice."

It made me think about the board fight and the packaging arguments and all the small battles that feel so exhausting. Maybe the point isn't that each individual fight changes everything. Maybe it's that enough people fighting enough small fights eventually adds up to something real. The Wayanad women didn't give up after the first rejection or the twentieth. They just kept doing the work.

I'm tired, but I'm not done. There's too much that needs doing and too few people willing to do it. That's not inspiring, it's just the situation. So we keep going.
