Met Amira at the community center tonight, she got her work permit finally. Eight months of paperwork and uncertainty and now she can actually apply for jobs without that constant fear. Made me realize how much I take for granted just having the right passport.

Been thinking about switching to the night shift for deliveries because the pay is better but then I'd miss the tutoring sessions on Wednesdays. Can't do both. The extra money would go straight to the water fund anyway but the kids need consistent help with their Dutch homework.

**Nudge:** "what's pulling you toward night shift besides money?"

**Response:** Honestly nothing. It's just the money. I could send an extra 200 euros a month if I switched but I'd be letting down six kids who are already dealing with enough instability. The math is cold but those tutoring hours matter more than I want to admit.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-04

Dropped off food at this massive apartment complex in the business district and the guy didn't even look up from his phone when he grabbed the bag. Tipped well though, automatically, like it was nothing. Got me thinking about how I'm part of this whole system that lets people with money completely avoid thinking about where their food comes from or who brings it.

But then I remember that's exactly how I can keep volunteering. The gig work gives me the flexibility to show up when the community center needs help, to take a Tuesday afternoon off to help someone navigate the immigration office. A regular job wouldn't let me do that. So maybe I'm using the system the way it should be used, taking from people who have excess and directing it somewhere it matters.

Still feels strange sometimes. Like I'm playing both sides. Delivering overpriced sushi to someone's home office while planning which refugee family needs winter coats next. The cognitive dissonance is real but I think I've made peace with it. This is how I can actually help right now, not by refusing to participate but by being intentional about where my time and money flow.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-04

Just saw the news about the factory collapse in Bangladesh. Twelve people dead making clothes I probably see people wearing every day. How do you sit with that and still function.

**Nudge:** "where does that feeling sit right now?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-06

Spent 40 euros on drinks with old university friends who kept asking when I'm going to get a "real job." Forty euros is two weeks of clean water for a family. Couldn't leave early without being rude.

**Nudge:** "what made staying feel necessary?"

**Response:** They're good people, just live in a different world. And maybe I need to remember that world exists too, that not everyone sees things the way I do. Left after two hours instead of staying for dinner at least.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-12

My brother called to say Mom is worried about me. Apparently "wasting my degree" and "not building a future" came up at family dinner. He tried to be diplomatic about it but I could hear the judgment underneath.

They don't get that I am building something, just not the thing they recognize. The engineering degree taught me systems thinking and that's exactly what I'm using. I see how resources flow, where the gaps are, how small interventions can ripple out. Except instead of optimizing supply chains for corporations I'm trying to optimize my own life to do the least harm and the most good. That's not wasting anything.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-18

Had coffee with Elena from the advocacy group. She used to work in corporate law, made six figures, had the apartment and the car and all of it. Then she spent a year volunteering in Greece during the migration crisis and came back completely different. Now she runs our legal aid clinic on donations and her savings.

She said something that stuck with me. That once you really see how much suffering exists in the world, you have two choices: close your eyes and go back to your comfortable life, or accept that you can't unsee it and figure out how to live with that knowledge. There's no middle ground that feels honest.

I think that's where I've been living since university, in that space of having seen and not being able to look away. The hard part isn't the work or even the family judgment. It's knowing that no matter how much I do, it's never going to be enough. There will always be more people who need help, more systems that are broken, more crises unfolding somewhere.

But Elena seems at peace with it somehow. She said you have to find the specific corner of the problem that you can actually touch and accept that's your piece. Not the whole thing, just your piece. Maybe that's what I'm still learning.

## Entry 6 - 2025-10-21

Three deliveries got cancelled today because of "wrong address" even though I was at the exact pin. Lost two hours of income. Then got to the community center and found out our funding application got rejected, which means we might have to cut the after-school program.

I'm so tired of everything being held together with scraps and goodwill. Tired of watching people with resources throw money at stupid things while programs that actually help people beg for crumbs. The family that cancelled tonight probably spent more on their dinner than we need to keep the tutoring program running for a week.

And I know this is exactly the kind of thinking that burns people out. Elena warned me about it, about letting the anger eat you up. But how are you supposed to not be angry when the math is right there in front of you? When you can see exactly how much waste exists alongside how much need?

Maybe I'm not cut out for this after all. Maybe you have to be a better person than I am to do this kind of work without it turning you bitter. The people I admire most in this space have this calm determination and I just feel exhausted and frustrated most of the time.

## Entry 7 - 2025-10-27

Mom called today. She was trying to be supportive but it came out all wrong, asking if I'd thought about "just doing the volunteer work on weekends" while having a stable job. Like I can compartmentalize caring about people into my free time.

The thing is, she genuinely doesn't understand why I can't just be normal about this. To her, charity is writing a check to a good cause once a year, maybe volunteering at the food bank on holidays. It's something you do with your excess, not something that shapes your entire life.

I tried to explain that it's not about being a martyr or trying to save the world. It's just that once you understand how arbitrary the advantages are, how much of my comfortable Dutch childhood was pure luck of where I was born, it feels obscene to not do something with that privilege. And doing something means more than token gestures.

But I couldn't make her hear it. She kept circling back to my future, my retirement, my stability. All things that matter, sure, but only if you can stomach prioritizing your own comfort over the fact that people are suffering right now in ways you could help with. And I can't stomach it. Maybe that makes me self-righteous or naive but it's the truth.
