## Entry 0 - 2025-05-29

My advisor asked today why I chose the topic of hospitality rituals in Levantine households when there are "more contemporary angles" I could take. I told her it was methodologically sound and left it at that. I don't owe anyone an explanation for why this subject matters to me. She's Swedish. She studies migration patterns. The way my grandmother set a table is not something she would understand, and I'm not interested in making it legible to her.

Came home and made musakhan from scratch, the whole process — rolling the dough, roasting the sumac onions until they were dark and sweet. Ate it alone at the kitchen table while my mother watched her show in the other room. The apartment smelled right. That was enough of an answer for one day.

**Nudge:** "You said you don't owe an explanation. But you came home and spent hours making your grandmother's dish. What was that about?"

**Response:** I like cooking. It's not that deep. The musakhan was good and I hadn't made it in a while. Sometimes dinner is just dinner.

## Entry 1 - 2025-06-03

Spent twelve hours in the library and barely got through two chapters of my lit review. My back hurts, my eyes hurt, and I keep wondering what possessed me to do this at forty-nine. Going to bed.

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-10

My brother Faisal made a comment at Friday lunch about how I'm "still playing student" while his sons are already building careers. His eldest is twenty-six and works at a bank. I smiled and passed the hummus. What I wanted to say was that I spent twenty years running hotel operations so our family name meant something in the hospitality industry, and now I'm doing something for myself, and that should be allowed.

But it wouldn't have been the right moment. My mother was sitting right there, and she gets anxious when Faisal and I disagree. So I stayed quiet, helped clear the plates, and drove home listening to Fairuz with the windows down. The breeze off the hills felt good. I don't need Faisal's approval. I know what I'm doing and why.

**Nudge:** "What would have happened if you'd actually said it?"

**Response:** My mother would have gone quiet. Faisal would have gotten louder. His wife Rania would have changed the subject to the children, which she always does. And on the drive home I would have felt worse, not better, because I'd have disrupted the one gathering that keeps us together. The lunch matters more than being right. That's something Faisal wouldn't understand because he's never had to choose.

Can't stop thinking about what Faisal said. Opened a bottle of that Jordanian red wine I've been saving and I'm sitting on the balcony. My mother would not approve of the wine but she went to bed early and what she doesn't see doesn't trouble her.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-12

Had a strange afternoon. After seminar I went to the old souk downtown instead of going home to write. I just walked. Bought a bag of roasted pistachios from the same vendor my father used to take me to when I was a boy. The man running it now is probably the vendor's grandson, same spot, same brass scale. I sat on a bench near the mosque and ate them slowly, one by one, listening to the call to prayer echo off the stone.

I haven't prayed regularly in years. My mother doesn't know this. She assumes I go to the mosque near campus on Fridays, and I don't correct her. The truth is I stopped feeling anything during prayer around the time I turned forty. The motions are still in my body — I could do them in my sleep — but the connection isn't there. And yet sitting there today, hearing the adhan bounce off those old walls while I cracked pistachios, I felt something close to what prayer used to give me. Stillness. Presence. The taste of salt and the sound of something ancient happening around me.

I don't know what to do with that. I can't tell my mother I've replaced prayer with pistachios and a bench. That would break her heart. But I also can't pretend the mosque still does for me what it used to. I'm stuck between what's honest and what's kind.

**Nudge:** "You described that moment on the bench as close to what prayer used to give you. What do you think changed?"

**Response:** I think I stopped believing that anyone was listening. Not God necessarily — I haven't worked that out — but the structure of it. The imam, the rows, the routine. It started to feel like I was performing for an audience that included my dead father and my living mother but not me. On the bench I wasn't performing for anyone. I was just a man eating pistachios in the late sun, and that was enough. Maybe what I lost wasn't faith. Maybe I lost the ability to feel things inside a frame someone else built, and I can only feel them when I stumble into them on my own. That's a lonely thought. But it felt true sitting there.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-15

My cohort went out for dinner last night at a rooftop restaurant in Jabal Amman. I almost didn't go. I had reading to finish and my mother had made lentil soup, and leaving her eating alone feels wrong even when she tells me to go. But I went, and I'm glad I did.

There were eight of us, all at different stages. Layla is twenty-seven and finishing her masters. Khaled is thirty-three and already published twice. And then there's me, the oldest by a decade and a half, ordering an extra plate of mezze because the lamb was extraordinary and the arak was cold and the evening air on that rooftop was exactly right. Layla asked me once why I came back to school so late, and I told her the truth — I wanted to, and I finally could, and life is too short to keep postponing the things that interest you.

She looked at me like I'd said something profound. I don't think it was. I think it was just unusual for someone my age in our context to say out loud that wanting something was reason enough to pursue it. Most of the men my brother's age would find that embarrassing. A man approaching fifty should have his affairs settled, not be starting over in a seminar room. But I'm not sure I care about what those men think anymore. The lamb was perfect. The conversation was good. I walked home through the old streets and felt awake in a way that the library doesn't give me.

**Nudge:** "You said you're not sure you care anymore what men your brother's age think. When did that start to shift?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-17

Spent the morning transcribing interviews for my fieldwork chapter. One of my subjects, a woman in her seventies from Irbid, described how she prepares mansaf for her family exactly the way her mother taught her, down to the specific way she folds the bread under the rice. She said she doesn't think about why she does it that way. She just does. Her hands know.

That's the thing I'm trying to capture in this dissertation and I keep circling around it without landing. The knowledge that lives in practice, not in explanation. My advisor wants me to theorize it and I understand why, but there's something that gets lost when you turn a grandmother's hands into a framework. I don't have a solution yet. I just know the gap is there and it bothers me.

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-18

My mother made knafeh today. She does this maybe twice a year, always unannounced, and when I came home from campus the whole apartment smelled like orange blossom and melted cheese. She was standing at the stove watching it with that focused expression she gets, and I sat at the kitchen table pretending to read but really just watching her.

She's seventy-six. Her hands shake a little now but she still moves through the kitchen with this sureness that I don't have anywhere in my life. She poured the syrup in one smooth motion, tilted the pan, pressed the edges with a spoon. Every step inherited from her mother, who learned from her mother before that.

I ate two pieces standing at the counter before she'd even plated it properly and she swatted my hand and called me greedy. I am greedy. I wanted a third piece and I took it. The sweetness was so intense it almost hurt, that good kind of too-much where your whole mouth is alive. My mother watched me eat and looked satisfied in a way that goes deeper than food. She was feeding her son. That's a complete sentence in her world.

Later I sat with my laptop open and thought about how this is exactly what my dissertation is about, but I can't write about my own mother. It would feel like a betrayal. Like turning something sacred into data. But she's the reason I'm writing about any of this in the first place.

**Nudge:** "You called it a betrayal to write about your mother. What would it mean if you did?"

**Response:** It would mean she becomes a subject. A case study. Her knafeh becomes "an example of embodied intergenerational knowledge transfer" and the orange blossom becomes a footnote. I'd be taking something that belongs to our kitchen and putting it in a seminar room for people who have never tasted it to analyze. My advisor would call that rigorous. I'd call it taking something warm and making it cold. I know that's not a rational objection. I just feel it in my chest when I think about writing her name in an academic paper. She deserves better than being theorized.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-19

Canceled my library session today and drove to the Dead Sea. Told myself it was for thinking but really I just wanted to float. Paid for one of the resort day passes, the expensive one with the private beach and the buffet lunch. My fellowship stipend doesn't really cover that kind of thing but I did it anyway. Lay in the water for an hour, completely weightless, staring at the sky.

The buffet was ridiculous. Grilled prawns, tabbouleh, four kinds of baklava. I ate slowly and deliberately and didn't check my phone once. Drove home in the early evening with the salt drying on my skin and this lightness I haven't felt in weeks. I know I should have been writing. The chapter is overdue. But I can't bring myself to feel guilty about it.

**Nudge:** "You said you can't bring yourself to feel guilty. Is that new?"

**Response:** Not really. I've always been someone who needs a good meal and a change of scenery to function. The Dead Sea was beautiful and now I'm recharged. I'll write tomorrow. It's fine.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-19

Sat down to write after the Dead Sea trip. Got four hundred words down, all of them bad. My mother asked if I'd been to campus today and I said yes. First time I've lied to her about something this small. Too tired to think about what that means.

## Entry 10 - 2025-06-22

Got an email from my advisor asking me to justify why my fieldwork methodology is "sufficiently distanced" from my own background. She phrased it politely but the implication is clear — studying my own culture's domestic practices introduces bias. As if the Swedish anthropologists who study Swedish folk customs don't exist. As if proximity is only a problem when you're from the region being studied.

I wrote a professional reply explaining my positionality framework and reflexive methodology. It was measured and appropriate. But sitting here now, I want to throw something. I left a career. I'm spending my savings. My mother eats dinner alone three nights a week because I'm at the library. And someone who has never set foot in a Jordanian kitchen is telling me I'm too close to the food. I need her approval to move forward with this chapter. But some nights the cost of fitting myself into their frame feels like it's eating the thing that brought me here.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned the cost of fitting yourself into their frame. What's the thing you're afraid of losing?"

**Response:** The feeling. That's what I'm afraid of losing. The reason I walked into a classroom at forty-nine wasn't the degree or the title. It was because something about the way my mother cooks, the way that woman in Irbid folds bread, the way my father used to pour coffee for guests with both hands — those things mean something, and I wanted to understand why they move me the way they do. But the more I translate that into academic language, the further I get from the feeling that started it. I'm terrified that by the time I finish this dissertation, I'll have a perfect theoretical framework for something I can no longer feel. And then what was the point? I'll have turned something alive into something correct. My advisor would say that's the job. But I don't want that to be my job. I want to hold both — the rigor and the warmth. I just don't know if the institution lets you do that.
