The exhibition proposal went through. Three years of work, and the municipal committee finally said yes. I spent the morning just sitting with the letter, reading it over again. The installation will be about the rising waters—the families in Bangladesh, the villages disappearing, but also what it means here, for us, watching from our safe harbors.

I called my mother to tell her. She asked if it meant I wouldn't have to worry about rent anymore. I said yes, for a while. She sounded relieved. So am I, honestly. The grant covers materials and a modest stipend. It's not wealth, but it's enough to stop checking my account every morning.

Strange to feel both grounded and ambitious at once. Usually those pull in different directions for me.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-08

Spent the whole day researching for the installation and now I can't sleep. The numbers are overwhelming—millions displaced, coastlines eroding, and we're here arguing about parking spaces and bicycle lanes. Not that those don't matter. They do. But the scale of it.

My neighbor Hans stopped by, wanted to borrow sugar of all things, and I ended up talking at him for twenty minutes about sea level projections. Poor man just wanted to bake a cake. He nodded politely and escaped as soon as he could. I do this. I know I do this. The work consumes me and then I become insufferable.

But also: what are we supposed to do? Make art that no one sees? Make art that everyone sees but changes nothing? I keep thinking about that Adrienne Rich line about diving into the wreck. The thing itself and not the myth. I want to make something true. Something that matters. But I also want to pay my electricity bill and not have a panic attack every time my card gets declined.

The residency helps. God, it helps so much. But it's three years and then what? Back to the hustle. Back to applying for everything, hearing nothing. I'm too old for this uncertainty. Or maybe I'm exactly old enough to know it never goes away.

**Nudge:** "You mention being 'too old for this uncertainty' but also describe being consumed by work that matters to you. How do you sit with both of those truths?"

**Response:** I suppose I've always thought I'd have to choose eventually. That at some point the responsible thing would be to give up the art and get a real job, whatever that means. My father certainly thought so. But here I am at fifty-one, and I haven't chosen. I just keep doing both—worrying and working. Maybe that is the choice. Maybe the tension is the point, not something to resolve. The discomfort keeps me honest. Keeps me from getting too comfortable with my little grants and my little installations while the world burns.

Studio day. Cut seventeen panels for the base structure. Hands are sore. The plywood is heavier than I remembered, or I'm weaker. Probably both.

Got a call from the arts center about scheduling. They want to move my opening back two weeks. I said fine. It doesn't really matter.

Leftovers for dinner. Early bed.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-19

The news today. Another boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Forty-seven people. They had names. They had families waiting for them. And I'm here in my warm studio, making art about their suffering while drinking expensive coffee.

I called Ingrid and cried on the phone for half an hour. She said the work matters. She said bearing witness matters. I want to believe her but some days it feels like decoration. Like we're all just rearranging deck chairs.

My mother called later, worried about me. She heard something in my voice this morning. I told her I was fine. I'm not fine, but what can she do? She's eighty-three. She doesn't need my existential crises.

The panels are half-finished. Tomorrow I'll keep cutting. That's all I know how to do.

**Nudge:** "You describe feeling like the work is 'decoration.' Has there been a time when your art felt more connected to real impact?"

**Response:** Yes. In 2019, I did an installation at a refugee center in Berlin. Nothing fancy—just photographs and recorded voices, stories from people who'd made the crossing. A woman named Fatima came to the opening. She'd been one of the voices. She stood in front of her own image and wept, and then she hugged me. She said no one had ever asked her to tell her story before. That it mattered that someone wanted to listen.

I think about Fatima often. Whether she'd think this new work was useful or just... European guilt made pretty.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-23

Two days before Christmas. Studio closed for the holiday. I should be relieved but I don't know what to do with myself.

Bought presents for my mother. A scarf, some chocolate, a book about Danish gardens. Small things. Safe things. She doesn't want much anymore.

My back hurts. I've been hunched over those panels for weeks. Need to stretch more. Need to take care of this body that insists on getting older.

Sleep.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-30

Christmas with my mother was quiet. We ate roast duck and watched old films. She fell asleep on the couch around eight and I just sat there, watching her breathe. Thinking about how many more of these we might have.

She asked about the installation. I tried to explain the concept—the rising waters, the displaced families, the way I want viewers to feel implicated. She nodded and said, "You've always cared too much." Not a criticism. Just an observation.

Maybe that's true. Maybe caring too much is the only way I know how to be in the world. The alternative—not caring—seems worse. Deadening.

The new year approaches. I don't make resolutions anymore. I just try to keep working. Keep showing up. Keep paying attention to what hurts.

**Nudge:** "When you say you 'keep paying attention to what hurts'—are you referring to the world's pain, your own, or both?"

**Response:** Both, I suppose. Though I'm not sure there's much difference anymore. The work has a way of blurring those lines. When I'm deep in research about displacement, I feel displaced. When I'm cutting panels until my hands ache, the ache feels earned. Like penance, maybe. Or communion. I don't know. The question feels too large for the last day of the year.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-06

Got feedback from Katrine at the arts center today. She thinks the installation is "too heavy." Says audiences want hope. Says I should consider adding something uplifting at the end.

I smiled and said I'd think about it. What I wanted to say: hope is a luxury. Hope is what you get to feel when you're not the one drowning. But she controls my funding, so I nodded.

Ingrid says I should compromise. Pick my battles. She's probably right. She's usually right about these things. But every compromise feels like a small death. Another edge sanded down. Another truth made palatable.

Maybe I'm being stubborn. Maybe stubbornness is all I have left. The work will be what it is. If they don't like it, they can find someone else. Someone younger, cheaper, more optimistic.

**Nudge:** "You mention that 'every compromise feels like a small death,' yet you also nodded and smiled. What helps you decide which compromises to make?"

The base structure is done. All thirty-four panels, cut and sanded and ready for paint. I stood back today and looked at the skeleton of the thing—this rising wave that will eventually hold video projections, sound, the voices of people I've never met whose lives hang in the balance.

I thought about Katrine's feedback. The hope question. And I realized I was wrong to dismiss it entirely. Not because she's right that audiences need comfort, but because hope isn't the opposite of truth. Fatima in Berlin—she had hope. Impossible, stubborn hope. The families I've interviewed for this project, the ones who lost everything and started over—they have hope too. It's not naive. It's a form of resistance.

So I'm adding something. Not a happy ending, but a thread. A wall of handwritten messages from people who've rebuilt their lives after displacement. Their words, their handwriting. Small acts of continuation.

My mother would say I'm softening. Maybe I am. Maybe softening isn't the same as surrender.

The residency runs until 2027. Two more years of this stability. Two more years of being able to worry about the work instead of worrying about money. I'm grateful in a way I couldn't have articulated ten years ago. Grateful and still restless. Still wanting to make something true.

Outside, the harbor is gray. Winter light. The water rises imperceptibly, day by day. We're all just trying to stay afloat.
