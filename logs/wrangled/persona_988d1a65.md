# Persona 988d1a65: Marc Vandenberghe

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 988d1a65
- **Name:** Marc Vandenberghe
- **Age:** 49
- **Profession:** Manager
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Power
- **Bio:** Marc has spent twenty-two years climbing the ranks at a mid-sized logistics firm in Rotterdam, currently overseeing a division of forty-three people and reporting directly to the CEO. He pushed hard for the divisional restructure last year that put him in charge of both operations and client strategy, though the expanded scope has meant longer hours and friction with peers who wanted those responsibilities. His wife, Lotte, has started commenting that he treats dinner conversations like staff briefings, and his eldest daughter recently stopped asking him for advice altogether. He collects vintage watches and keeps a mental catalogue of who in the executive team drives what car.

Pieter talked right over me in the steering committee today, mid-sentence, and presented the container routing proposal like it was his. I just sat there. Too tired to fight it, too angry to let it go, and now it's midnight and I'm still turning it over.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from calling it out right there?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-02-22

Ran the quarterly review myself today, no slides from anyone else, just my numbers, my narrative. The room was quiet in that good way where people are actually listening. Felt like the division is finally mine in the way I wanted it to be.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-23

Needed sign-off from Legal on the new supplier contract. Straightforward, or so I thought. Sent it Thursday, followed up Friday morning, got told Anke was "reviewing priorities" and would get to it when she could. Meanwhile the supplier's deadline is Tuesday and I'm the one who'll look like I dropped the ball.

It's not even about the contract, really. It's that I had to sit there refreshing my inbox like some junior waiting for permission. I run a forty-three person division and I can't move a standard supplier agreement through because someone in a different department decides the timeline. I almost went to the CEO directly but thought better of it. Probably should have.

**Nudge:** "Why did you hold back from going to the CEO?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-26

Routine day. Back-to-back calls, budget reconciliation, nothing unusual. Grabbed a broodje kroket from the canteen and ate it at my desk between meetings.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-03

Monday. Staff meeting went long because Thomas wanted to discuss the new reporting structure again. I'd already decided on it two weeks ago and communicated it clearly, but apparently some people need to re-litigate everything. Let them talk for ten minutes, then moved on.

Lotte asked how work was over dinner. I said fine. She gave me that look, the one that means she knows I'm not actually answering. I wasn't trying to be evasive, I just genuinely didn't have the energy to translate the day into something she'd find interesting. Watched the football afterward, fell asleep on the couch again.

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-10

Had a clear plan for the fleet optimization rollout. Presented it in the ops meeting. Sandra pushed back hard, said we should phase it differently, go region by region instead of all at once. Others started nodding along with her, and I could feel the room shifting.

I ended up agreeing to her phased approach. It's not wrong, technically. But it wasn't my call anymore, and everyone in that room saw it happen. I keep telling myself it doesn't matter how we get there as long as we get there. Not sure I believe that.

**Nudge:** "What exactly changed when the room shifted to Sandra's side?"

**Response:** It wasn't about the plan. It was that they looked at her like she was in charge of the decision.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-16

Sunday but I can't stop thinking about Friday. New hire, Jeroen, fresh from his MBA, has been here eight weeks. In the project kickoff he interrupted me to "build on" my point, then spent five minutes explaining container throughput metrics to me like I haven't been running this operation for a decade. The room just let it happen. Nobody stepped in.

What gets me is that I know this kid's type. He's positioning. He's already had coffee with the CEO twice, which I only know because I saw it in the calendar. And I just sat there and let him reframe my own analysis back to me. I should have shut it down. I should have said, "Jeroen, I've been doing this since before you started your bachelor's." But I didn't. I smiled and nodded like it was a collaborative discussion.

I keep thinking about what my father would say. He ran his own business for thirty years and nobody ever talked over him because he made sure of it from day one. I don't know when I started letting people do this to me. Maybe it's the restructure, maybe I'm spread too thin to fight every battle. But it feels like something I'm losing and I can't quite name what it is.

**Nudge:** "What is it you think you're losing?"

**Response:** The room's assumption that I'm the one who decides.

Pieter did it again in the client call. Spoke over me, redirected the conversation to his numbers. I corrected him this time but it came out sharper than I meant and the client noticed.

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-23

Quiet Sunday, Lotte took the girls to her mother's in Leiden. House to myself. Made coffee the slow way, French press, sat in the kitchen looking at the garden. The hedge needs cutting again. Thought about calling my brother but didn't, we'd just end up talking about the house in Zeeland that neither of us wants to deal with.

Spent an hour going through old emails, not for work reasons, just sorting. Found some from when I first got promoted to division head. I was so careful in those early messages, checking every word. Now I fire things off without thinking. Not sure if that's confidence or just not caring as much.

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-25

Had a one-on-one with Lisa from my team today. She's been struggling with the new reporting system and came in looking like she expected to be reprimanded. I didn't do that. Just walked through it with her, showed her the shortcuts I use, told her it took me three months to stop hating the interface too. She actually laughed.

Small thing, but it reminded me of something. When people come to me for direction and I give it clearly, no games, no politics, just here's how we do this — that's when I feel most like myself. Not the boardroom stuff, not the jockeying. Just someone who knows what they're doing, passing it on. Drove home in a decent mood for once.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-26

Board prep meeting today. The CFO asked me to "walk him through" my division's numbers as if I hadn't already submitted a forty-page deck last week. He does this to me every quarter. He doesn't do it to Pieter, doesn't do it to Sandra. Just me. Like I need to audition for the right to present my own results.

I complied, obviously. Went through it line by line, smiled, answered his follow-ups. Drove home and sat in the car in the garage for ten minutes before going inside. Lotte asked if I was okay and I said yes. I wasn't really.

**Nudge:** "What were you thinking about in those ten minutes in the car?"

**Response:** Just decompressing. Long day.

## Entry 11 - 2025-03-31

End of Q1. Numbers look solid, team's holding together, nothing on fire. Booked a table at De Kas for Lotte's birthday next week. Normal Monday, which at this point I'll take.
