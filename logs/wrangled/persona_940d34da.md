## Entry 0 - 2025-07-25

Four hundred bucks today, which is solid, but man my knee is screaming. Had this moment around 3pm where I was sitting in my car outside some guy's apartment waiting for him to come down and I just started laughing because I remembered this time in 2019 when I was rappelling into a canyon fire in New Mexico and thinking "this is it, this is what life should feel like." Now I'm waiting for some dude to get his Thai food.

It's not bad though. Like I genuinely don't hate this. The freedom part is real—nobody tells me when to start, when to stop, I can take a Tuesday off if I want to drive up to the mountains and just sit. Rachel thinks I'm avoiding something. Maybe I am. But four hundred bucks is four hundred bucks and the drone business hit $800 in sales this month. That's momentum.

**Nudge:** "What does Rachel think you're avoiding exactly?"

**Response:** She thinks I'm avoiding commitment. Like capital-C commitment—a real job with benefits, a retirement plan, maybe a ring. She's not wrong that I'm not chasing those things, but I don't think I'm avoiding them either. I just don't see them as the only path. The drone thing could actually become something real. I sold a Phantom 4 Pro yesterday to a real estate photographer who found me on Facebook Marketplace. That's a client, not just a sale.

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-01

Rachel's brother came over for dinner last night and the whole thing turned into this intervention I didn't ask for. He's a project manager at Lockheed, makes probably three times what I do, and he kept asking "but what's the long-term plan here?" like I'm some kind of lost teenager. I'm 38 years old. I've fought wildfires. I've pulled people out of avalanches. I've built a side business from nothing while working 50-hour weeks in a car. But sure, Kevin, tell me about your 401k match.

The thing that pissed me off the most is that Rachel didn't say anything. She just sat there nodding at some of his points. We talked after he left and she said she "understands both sides" which is code for "I agree with him but don't want to fight." I get that she wants stability. I do. But I'm not going to take some cubicle job just so Kevin can stop worrying about me at Thanksgiving.

I know I sound defensive. I am defensive. But there's a difference between not having a plan and having a plan that other people don't recognize as one. The drone business did $800 this month. If I can hit $2000/month by December, that's rent covered. That's not nothing. That's a runway.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned runway—but runway to what?"

**Response:** To not having to drive for DoorDash anymore. To selling drones full-time, maybe training people to fly them, partnering with the real estate guy to do aerial shoots. There's a path here. It's just not a straight line with a pension at the end. It's more like—I build something piece by piece until one day I look around and I'm not hustling anymore, I'm running something.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-01

Still thinking about last night. Couldn't sleep. Kevin's voice in my head: "But what if the drone thing doesn't work out?" Like failure is this thing that only happens to people who try unconventional stuff. His job is so safe it's practically embalmed and he acts like that makes him wise.

I texted my old crew chief from the fire days, Dario. He's in Tucson now doing hazmat consulting. He said "bro you gotta stop explaining yourself to people who already decided you're wrong." He's right. But it's hard when one of those people sleeps next to you.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-03

Worked 11 hours. Three apps running simultaneously. Knee is bad. Rachel and I haven't really talked since the Kevin thing and the apartment feels weird.

**Nudge:** "Weird how?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-03

She finally said it. "I don't know if this is working for me." Not the relationship—the whole thing. The uncertainty. The not knowing if I'll make $300 or $500 in a given week. The drone boxes stacked in the spare room. The fact that I'm 38 and we're still splitting rent instead of building toward something "together."

I told her I AM building toward something. She said "but it's YOUR something. Where am I in it?" And I didn't have a good answer for that. Because honestly I haven't thought about it that way. I've been so focused on proving that my way works that I forgot to check if she wanted to be on the ride.

But also—and I know this sounds cold—is it my job to make her feel secure? She knew who I was when we started dating. I was doing ski patrol then, seasonal work, no guaranteed paycheck. She thought it was exciting. Now it's a problem? People want the story of the adventurous guy but not the actual life that comes with it.

I don't know. Maybe I'm the one who's wrong here. But it doesn't feel wrong. It feels like I'm being asked to become someone else.

**Nudge:** "Who would you become if you gave her what she's asking for?"

**Response:** I don't even know what she's asking for. A different job? A proposal? A five-year plan with bullet points? She says "stability" but that means different things. My parents had stable jobs and they were miserable for 30 years. I'd rather be broke and building something than comfortable and dead inside.

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-03

Third entry today, I know. Can't stop spinning on this.

Rachel went to her sister's for the night. Said she needed space to think. I said okay and then I sat in the apartment alone eating leftover pad thai and feeling like the walls were closing in. Which is ironic because I literally fought claustrophobia for years—you can't do wildland work if you panic in tight spaces—but emotional claustrophobia is apparently different.

I pulled up my old photos from the fire days. There's one from a job in Oregon, 2017, where we're all standing in front of this blackened hillside at dawn after a 14-hour shift. Everyone's covered in ash and grinning. We'd just saved a subdivision. I remember feeling like I mattered, like the work mattered, like I was exactly where I was supposed to be.

I don't feel that now. The drone stuff is cool when it's working but it doesn't hit the same. And driving—driving is just time traded for money, nothing more. I keep telling myself it's temporary, it's a bridge, but bridges are supposed to lead somewhere and I'm not sure mine does anymore.

Maybe Rachel is right to question it. I just wish she questioned WITH me instead of AT me.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-04

Rachel came back this morning. We talked for two hours. She's not leaving, but she's also not okay with things continuing exactly as they are. We agreed to try couples counseling, which I never thought I'd say yes to, but here we are.

She made one point that stuck: she said she doesn't want me to change who I am, she wants to feel like she's part of the plan, not just watching from the sidelines. That's fair. I've been treating the drone business like my thing and the relationship like our thing, but they're not separate. If I succeed, she's there. If I fail, she's there. She deserves to know the stakes.

**Nudge:** "How'd it feel saying yes to that?"

**Response:** Honestly? Terrifying. Counseling feels like admitting something is broken. But maybe that's the old me talking—the guy who thinks asking for help is weakness. Dario told me once that the smartest firefighters are the ones who call for backup early. Maybe relationships work the same way. I'd rather get help now than watch the whole thing burn down because I was too proud to call it in.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-10

First counseling session was yesterday. Weird to have a stranger summarize your relationship in 50 minutes. She said we have "different risk tolerances" and "misaligned timelines." Which, yeah, that tracks. But she also said something that hit different: she said I might be using constant motion as a way to avoid examining whether I'm actually happy.

That's been rattling around in my head ever since. Because the thing is—I'm not sure I know what happiness looks like when it's not tied to a goal. Like, I was happy fighting fires because I was good at it and it was hard and people respected it. I was happy when the drone business made its first sale because it proved the concept worked. But am I happy just... existing? On a Tuesday afternoon with nothing to prove?

Rachel asked me later what I'd do if I couldn't work. Not retirement—like, if I got injured again, worse than the knee, and couldn't drive, couldn't rebuild drones, couldn't hustle. What would be left? I said "you" but even as I said it I wasn't sure I believed it. Because I don't know who I am when I'm not chasing something.

That's a problem, probably. The counselor would say it's a problem. Rachel would say it's a problem. But part of me wonders if it's just... how I'm built. Some people are wired to sit still. I'm wired to move. The question is whether that's a feature or a bug, and whether the answer even matters if it means losing someone I love.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to be still and not feel like you're dying?"

**Response:** I genuinely don't know. My dad retired at 62 and was dead by 65—not physically, but like, the light went out. He used to build furniture in the garage and one day he just stopped. Said there was no point. That terrifies me more than anything Rachel's brother ever said about 401ks. So maybe stillness isn't the goal. Maybe it's about finding the right kind of motion—something that includes her, something that matters, something that isn't just running from the thing I'm afraid of.
