## Entry 0 - 2025-12-15

The Hamburg project is on hold. The city council voted to delay the commission review until March, citing budget reallocation concerns. I found out through my gallery contact, not from the committee chair who promised to keep me informed directly. That's two months of planning, three revised proposals, and a scale model my team spent five weeks fabricating.

I called Martina, the head of the cultural affairs department, and she said the delay was procedural. No guarantees about the final decision. When I asked about the competing submissions, she went quiet. There are competing submissions now. Nobody mentioned that before.

My assistant Werner suggested we could use the time to refine the proposal further. I told him the proposal doesn't need refining. What it needs is for people to honor their word. The original brief came to me because of my work in Frankfurt and Munich. Now there are suddenly other artists in the conversation.

Spent the evening alone in the studio. Didn't work on anything. Just sat with a glass of Burgundy and looked at the model. It's good work. The proportions are right, the way it catches light from the north side. Should have been straightforward.

**Nudge:** "Why alone tonight instead of calling someone?"

**Response:** Who would I call? Werner just tells me what I want to hear. My ex-wife would say I brought this on myself with my ego. My collector friends would offer sympathy but secretly wonder if I'm losing my touch. The wine was better company.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-18

Meeting today with the Becker family about their estate commission. Third generation textile money, building a new country house in Baden-Württemberg. They want something for the entrance courtyard. Five meters minimum, abstract but with classical proportions. Budget is essentially open.

Herr Becker junior did most of the talking. Young man, maybe thirty-five, clearly trying to establish himself as the decision-maker now that his father has stepped back. He kept referencing installations he'd seen in Basel and New York. Wanted to know my thoughts on incorporating water features. I told him bronze and water require careful engineering, which adds six months minimum to the timeline.

His wife seemed more interested in the aesthetic conversation. She asked good questions about patina development over decades. I showed them photos of my Frankfurt piece from 2008 and how it's aged. She understood immediately what I was explaining about surface evolution.

Left the meeting feeling solid about the project. Private commissions like this are cleaner. One family, one vision, one contract. No committees, no budget votes, no competing proposals appearing from nowhere. The fee will be substantial. I'm already thinking about how to spend the spring - perhaps extend the Mallorca stay into April this year.

**Nudge:** "Which of them do you think will actually decide?"

**Response:** The wife. Herr Becker junior wants to prove he's running things, but she's the one with the eye. He'll defer to her judgment on anything visual. I've seen this dynamic before with these families. The money gives orders, but taste steers the ship. I'll make sure my next presentation speaks to what she responded to.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-25

Christmas dinner at my sister's in Cologne. Too many relatives, too much noise. Drove back late and opened a 2015 Barolo I'd been saving.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-28

Received the formal letter from Hamburg today. The commission has been opened to a juried competition. My original invitation as the presumptive artist is now simply one submission among what they expect will be twelve to fifteen proposals. They frame it as fairness and transparency. I frame it as cowardice.

I built relationships with that cultural department for eight years. Hosted their delegation when they visited my Munich installation. Introduced Martina to collectors who later funded her gallery renovation. This is how it works in this world - you invest in people, build mutual obligation, and when opportunities arise, those investments pay returns. Now some junior bureaucrat has decided that giving me what I earned looks like favoritism. I may withdraw entirely. Let them have their competition with their fifteen proposals from artists who haven't done a single public piece over ten meters.

**Nudge:** "What would withdrawing actually prove?"

**Response:** That I don't need to compete for something that should have been mine by right. That my reputation speaks without having to perform for a jury of people who probably couldn't name three working sculptors. Maybe nothing. Maybe I'm just angry and this is how it comes out. The Becker commission will pay better anyway.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-30

Had dinner with Joachim, an old friend from my academy days. He never pursued public commissions - works entirely through private galleries and collectors. Smaller pieces, more experimental. He mentioned he spent November in Portugal, just making work in a rented studio with no deadlines, no clients, no obligations. Came back with a series he's genuinely excited about.

I found myself envying that. Not the smaller scale or the lesser income, but the freedom from always positioning. Every conversation I have lately is a negotiation. Who gets credit, who controls the timeline, who has final say. Even the Becker project - I'm already calculating how to manage the son's ego while cultivating the wife's trust. Joachim just makes things. When did I stop doing that?

**Nudge:** "Could you actually work that way now?"

**Response:** I don't know. The studio, the assistants, the Mallorca house - they all require the income that comes from the positioning. But it's not just about money. I'm not sure I'd know what to make if nobody was watching. Joachim's work comes from somewhere inside him. Mine comes from briefs and site specifications. Maybe that's fine. Maybe that's just who I became. The question bothers me more than I expected.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-31

New Year's Eve at the Düsseldorf Kunstverein event. Good turnout, the usual faces. I wore my grey Zegna and the Patek I bought myself after the Munich commission. People came over to talk, asked about my projects, laughed at my stories about difficult clients. The museum director mentioned they're planning a retrospective series next year featuring regional artists. My name came up in their planning meeting.

Drove home after midnight feeling satisfied. This is what the work is for - not just the objects themselves but the standing they create. The ability to walk into a room and have people know who you are and what you've accomplished. Joachim wouldn't understand this. He'd find it exhausting or empty. But there's genuine satisfaction in being recognized. I've earned that standing through decades of difficult work. Tonight felt like confirmation.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-05

Spent the day in the studio actually working. Not managing, not planning, not reviewing contracts. Put on old clothes and spent six hours with clay, building maquettes for the Becker piece. Three different approaches to the water feature question - one that incorporates it, one that acknowledges the site's water table through the form without literal water, one that ignores it entirely.

My hands remembered things my mind had forgotten. The resistance of material, the way a form wants to go one direction but you have to convince it to go another. Werner came in at some point to ask about scheduling and I didn't even look up, just told him we'd discuss it tomorrow. By evening my back hurt and my shoulders were stiff and I felt better than I have in weeks. Opened a good Riesling and sat looking at what I'd made.

**Nudge:** "What made today different from usual?"

**Response:** No audience. Nothing to prove to anyone. Just me and the clay and the problem of how to fill that courtyard space. The Becker meeting, the Hamburg situation, even the Kunstverein evening - there's always a performance involved. Today was just doing the thing itself. I'd forgotten how much I used to need that. Maybe still do.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-12

Presentation to the Beckers today. Brought all three maquettes. Herr Becker junior immediately gravitated toward the most literal interpretation - the water feature, the dramatic scale, the impressive engineering. He started talking about how visitors would experience it, the Instagram moments, the way it would announce the family's arrival into a new era.

His wife was quiet for a long time. Then she pointed to the smallest maquette - the one where the form echoes the water table beneath without any actual water. She said it felt inevitable. Like it belonged to the land rather than being imposed on it. Her husband looked irritated for a moment, then asked what I thought.

I told them the truth: the water feature would be magnificent and expensive. The subtle piece would be better art. I could see Herr Becker calculating - the subtle piece was also a third of the budget. For a moment I wondered if I'd just talked myself out of substantial money.

In the end they went with the subtle piece. The wife's choice. I'm genuinely pleased, which surprises me. A year ago I would have steered them toward the bigger commission without hesitation. The income loss is real but manageable. And I'll actually enjoy making this one. That matters more than I thought it would.

**Nudge:** "What changed in the last year?"

**Response:** Maybe nothing changed. Maybe I just got old enough to notice what was already there. The Hamburg situation reminded me that all the positioning and relationship-building can evaporate overnight. The status game has diminishing returns after a certain point. I have enough. The studio, the houses, the reputation - it's all established. What I don't have enough of is days like that one in January, alone with clay and no audience. The Becker piece might give me more of those.
