Staff meeting today went sideways. The principal announced they're changing the Class III syllabus mid-term and everyone just nodded along like this was normal. I sat there wanting to say something because I've already prepped my unit plans through June and this throws everything off. But Mrs. Kulkarni was agreeing, and she's been teaching twenty-three years, so what do I know. I just kept quiet and wrote notes.

After the meeting Neha—she joined the same year as me—asked if I thought the change made sense. I said it was fine, it'll be fine. She looked at me like she knew I was lying. I probably was. The thing is, even if I did speak up, what would I say? "Excuse me, ma'am, I disagree"? That's not how it works here. You're new, you keep your head down, you follow the lead of people who've been around longer. That's what Amma always says.

But walking home I kept replaying it and feeling this tight, hot thing in my chest. Not anger exactly. More like frustration at myself for not even trying. I had a valid point and I swallowed it whole. I do this constantly. In meetings, at family dinners, everywhere. I just smile and go along with things and then come home and feel this restless itch like I've betrayed something. I don't even know what.

**Nudge:** "What do you think you betrayed?"

**Response:** Maybe my own opinion? Like the fact that I even had one. Everyone assumes I'm just agreeable by nature but sometimes I have things I want to say and I just... don't. And then it's like those thoughts don't count because I never let them out. It's exhausting pretending you don't have a voice.

Quiet week at school. Adjusted the unit plans to fit the new syllabus. Amma said she was proud of me for not making a fuss.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-16

Parent-teacher meetings ran until seven tonight. I'm so tired I can barely think straight. Had a difficult conversation with one father who was upset about his son's handwriting marks. He kept raising his voice and I kept saying "I understand, uncle" over and over like a broken toy. Mrs. Kulkarni was in the next room, she could hear everything, and afterwards she said I handled it well. "You didn't escalate," she said, like that's the highest praise.

And honestly, part of me is glad I stayed calm. That's how you're supposed to handle these things. You listen, you don't react, you let the other person feel heard. Amma taught me that. Baba would say the same—don't give anyone a reason to complain about you.

But another part of me wanted to tell that man his son's handwriting isn't poor because of me, it's because the boy doesn't practise at home. I had the words right there. I didn't say them. I never do. Came home, ate dinner in silence, helped Bhabhi clear the dishes. Now I'm lying in bed typing this and I can still hear his raised voice in my head. I wish it didn't stick.

**Nudge:** "What is it about raised voices that sticks with you?"

**Response:** I think it's because I associate them with something going wrong. Like if someone raises their voice at me, I've failed at keeping things smooth. Which I know is ridiculous because he was being unreasonable. But my whole body just goes into this mode where I have to fix it, calm it down, make it okay. I've been like this since I was small. Loud voices in the house meant someone was unhappy and it was everyone's job to make it stop.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-20

Dadiji called today to discuss Rakshabandhan plans even though it's months away. She wants everyone at her place in Nashik, full family, all the cousins, the usual production. I said of course, yes, we'll be there, before even checking with Baba or Amma. Didn't even occur to me to say maybe or let me check. It was automatic, like a reflex I didn't know I had.

Neha invited me to a weekend workshop on creative teaching methods in Mumbai that same weekend. I said I couldn't go without even thinking about it. She asked why and I just said family commitments. She didn't push but I could tell she wanted to.

**Nudge:** "Did you want to go to that workshop?"

**Response:** It doesn't really matter, does it? Dadiji's plans are set. You don't skip family things for a workshop. That's just how it is.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-22

Something happened at lunch today. A group of the senior teachers were discussing a student in my class—Arjun, the one who's been acting out. They were saying he needs stricter discipline, maybe a note home to his parents. I know Arjun. His parents are going through a separation and he's been coming to school with unwashed uniforms. He doesn't need punishment, he needs someone to be patient with him.

I almost said something. I opened my mouth and Mrs. Deshpande looked at me and I just said "yes ma'am, I'll send the note." I felt sick walking back to my classroom. Still do.

**Nudge:** "You said you felt sick—what part exactly?"

**Response:** Because I know I'm right about Arjun and I still didn't say it. It's one thing to stay quiet about syllabus changes or meeting agendas—that's just politics. But this is a child. I'm supposed to be looking out for him. Instead I folded because a teacher with more years looked at me a certain way. What kind of teacher does that make me?

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-22

Writing again because I can't sleep. I keep thinking about Arjun and the note I'm supposed to send. I haven't written it yet. Part of me wants to just talk to his mother directly, gently, without framing it as a disciplinary thing. I could say something like "I've noticed he seems distracted, is everything okay at home." That's not disobeying anyone. That's just being a teacher.

But then I imagine Mrs. Deshpande finding out I went around her suggestion and the thought makes my stomach drop. She's the one who writes my probation review. She's been teaching since before I was born. Who am I to decide my approach is better?

And yet I keep coming back to Arjun's face when I told the class to take out their notebooks yesterday. He didn't have his. He just sat there looking small. I smiled at him and quietly gave him a spare. Nobody noticed. That felt right. The note home doesn't feel right. But doing what feels right and doing what you're told are two different things and I don't know when I got so afraid of the gap between them.

Spoke to Arjun's mother after school today, just casually near the gate. Kept it light, asked how things were going. She got teary and said it's been a hard few months. I told her I'd keep an eye on him and she held my hand and thanked me. I didn't mention the note.

Mrs. Deshpande asked if I'd sent it. I said I spoke with the mother directly and she seemed satisfied. Mrs. Deshpande paused, then said "fine." It wasn't warm but it wasn't a reprimand either. I survived it. My heart was pounding the entire time though.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-30

Friday and I'm sitting on the balcony while everyone watches that serial on TV. Bhabhi asked if I wanted to join and I said in a minute but I just want to sit here with the noise from the street and not talk to anyone for a bit.

This week has been strange. The Arjun thing—I keep turning it over. I did something different. I didn't just follow orders. I found a way to do what I thought was right without directly confronting anyone. Maybe that's the only way I can operate. Not rebellion, not silence, something in between. Like, I bent the expectation without breaking it. And nothing bad happened. Mrs. Deshpande didn't yell at me, Arjun's mother was grateful, the world didn't end.

I think I've been telling myself a story that any deviation from what's expected will result in disaster. Like if I push back even slightly, everything will collapse—my reputation, my relationships, my family's opinion of me. But today I'm sitting here and nothing collapsed. The serial is still playing, Bhabhi is still laughing, Amma just brought me chai without asking. Everything is the same except I feel a tiny bit less compressed. Like there's a millimeter more room inside my chest.

**Nudge:** "That millimeter of room—what does it feel like?"

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-01

Cousin Meera announced she's moving to Bangalore for a job. Whole family is upset. Dadiji called it selfish. I sat there thinking she's brave but I said nothing because everyone was already piling on.

**Nudge:** "You thought she was brave?"

**Response:** I mean, it takes guts to do something your family doesn't approve of. That's all. I'm not saying she's right or wrong. It's not my place.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-02

Amma asked me at breakfast if I'd ever "do something like Meera." I said no, of course not. She looked relieved. I don't know why that relief felt like a small door closing.

## Entry 10 - 2025-06-07

End of term assessments all week. I'm marking papers every night until midnight and still helping Bhabhi with the kids in the morning because she has a cold. I don't mind helping—that's what family does. But I haven't had an hour to myself in I don't know how long. Every minute is either school or home duties.

Neha asked me to grab chai after school and I said I couldn't because I had marking to finish. That was true but also I knew if I went home late Amma would ask where I was and I'd have to explain and it just felt like more effort than it was worth. Sometimes the path of least resistance is the only path I have energy for.

**Nudge:** "What would you have talked about with Neha if you'd gone?"

**Response:** Probably everything I can't say at home. She's the only person who gets it—being new, being young, trying to figure out if you're a good teacher or just an obedient one. Last time we talked she said she argued with the vice principal about textbook choices and won. I was equal parts impressed and horrified. I wanted to ask how she does it, how she speaks up without her whole body shutting down. But I ran out of time.

## Entry 11 - 2025-06-14

Report cards went home yesterday and a parent emailed the principal to say I graded her daughter too harshly in Hindi. The principal called me in and asked me to "reconsider." Not directly, not as an order—just that little tilt of the head and "maybe you could take another look." I know what that means. It means change the grade.

The grade is accurate. I checked three times. The girl is struggling with grammar and I wrote detailed comments about how to improve. But the parent is on the school trust and the principal doesn't want problems. So now I'm sitting here trying to decide whether to bump a B+ to an A- to keep everyone comfortable.

I hate this. This is exactly the kind of thing I got into teaching to fight against—marking a child on who her parents are instead of what she's learned. But if I refuse, the principal remembers. My probation review is in August. Is one grade worth the trouble?

I already know what I'm going to do. I'm going to change it and tell myself it doesn't matter in the long run, and feel this same sick feeling I felt about Arjun, and go to bed and wake up tomorrow the same person who keeps the peace at any cost. And one day I'll wonder when I stopped trusting my own judgment. Or maybe I'll just stop noticing. That's the scarier thought.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for you not to change that grade?"

**Response:** Someone to tell me it's okay to hold my ground. Which is pathetic because I shouldn't need permission. But I've spent my whole life being told that keeping things smooth is the right thing to do, and when every single person around you believes that, it's hard to trust the one voice saying otherwise—especially when that voice is just mine.
