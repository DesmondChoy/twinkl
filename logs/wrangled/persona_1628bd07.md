Another steering committee meeting where half the room was on their phones. I run a tight agenda and still can't get people to care about infrastructure decisions that will haunt us for years. Nobody wants to own anything hard anymore.

**Nudge:** "What does it cost you when they check out like that?"

**Response:** It makes me wonder why I bother holding the line if nobody else will.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-20

Found out today they picked Raj for the VP role. The announcement went out at 2pm in a company-wide email. I heard about it from my skip-level before that, which I guess was supposed to soften the blow. Raj has been here six years. I have been here nineteen.

I am not saying he is unqualified. He ran the platform migration last year and it went well. But I have been running the reliability council since before he joined the company. I built the incident response process from nothing. Three directors told me privately that they assumed the role was mine. So either those conversations meant nothing or something changed that nobody told me about.

Had a one-on-one with my manager afterward. She said the decision came down to "organizational energy" and "forward-looking vision." I asked what that meant concretely and she pivoted to talking about how much they value my technical depth. That phrase again. Technical depth. It is starting to feel like a box they put you in when they do not see you leading.

**Nudge:** "Those three directors who assumed it was yours -- did any of them advocate for you?"

**Response:** I actually do not know. I assumed they did but maybe assuming was the whole problem.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-25

Spent most of Saturday reviewing the Q3 reliability targets. Updated my tracking sheet for the team. Chen is slipping again, two missed deadlines this month.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-25

Cannot stop thinking about the VP thing. Told myself I was over it but then I saw Raj's new title in the org chart and my chest got tight. Thirty years and I am still a "senior individual contributor." Hate that I care this much.

**Nudge:** "You said you hate that you care. What would it look like if you didn't?"

**Response:** Honestly I have no idea. I do not know who I am if I stop keeping score.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-01

Weird thing happened at the barbecue yesterday. Tom from next door, he retired from Boeing last year, he was talking about building a deck. Not a fancy deck, just a simple one off the back of his kitchen. And he was describing the process of picking the lumber, getting the permits, measuring everything twice, and I realized I was genuinely envious. Not of the deck. Of the way he talked about it. Like it mattered to him for no reason other than he wanted to do it.

I have not built anything with my hands in years. Used to do woodworking in my twenties before the career took off. I still have my dad's old chisels in the garage somewhere, wrapped in an oilcloth. I think about them sometimes.

After the barbecue I went home and sat in the garage for a while. Found the chisels. They were right where I left them, maybe eight years ago. The handles are still good. I did not do anything with them, just held one and felt the weight. Karen came out and asked what I was doing and I said "nothing" which I guess was technically true. But it did not feel like nothing.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-06

Long week. Raj scheduled a "vision alignment" meeting for the whole engineering org and I had to sit through it smiling. He is reorganizing the reliability council under his new structure which means my committee now reports up through him. Three years of building that group and now I am presenting to someone I used to mentor.

Karen noticed I have been staying up late. She asked if I was okay and I said I was fine, just busy. She did not push it. Part of me wanted her to push it.

**Nudge:** "Why not just tell Karen what's actually going on?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-08

Spent Sunday morning updating my LinkedIn profile. Added a few bullet points about the incident response framework and the reliability council. Looked at job postings out of curiosity. Principal engineer roles at three companies. Two of them pay more than what I make now.

Did not apply to any of them. Just screenshot the listings and saved them to a folder on my desktop called "Options." Have not decided if that is planning or procrastination.

**Nudge:** "That folder -- when do you think you will actually open it again?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-06-10

Had a skip-level with the CTO today. She asked me to lead a new cross-functional task force on AI readiness. Big scope, high visibility, reports directly to her. On paper it is exactly what I have been wanting. Direct line to the top, chance to shape strategy.

But I keep thinking about why now. Two weeks after passing me over they hand me a consolation project. Raj probably suggested it. I said yes because saying no would look petty. Not sure if I actually want to do it or if I just cannot stand to be seen turning down something important.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-13

Took a half day and went to the hardware store. Bought some walnut stock and a new set of clamps. Nothing serious, just enough to try a small cutting board. Felt strange buying something that has nothing to do with work or credentials or org charts.

Spent the afternoon in the garage planing the wood down. My technique is rusty but the motions came back faster than I expected. I was out there for three hours and did not check my phone once. I cannot remember the last time that happened.

**Nudge:** "Three hours without your phone. What was going through your head out there?"

**Response:** Mostly just the grain direction and whether my measurements were right. That was the whole point I think. Just the thing in front of me.

## Entry 9 - 2025-06-19

First AI task force meeting was today. I spent all weekend preparing a charter document, twelve pages, frameworks, timelines, resource asks. I presented it and the CTO said "this is thorough" which I used to take as a compliment but now I wonder if it means "too much." She asked if we could "move faster and iterate." That phrase.

Raj sat in on the meeting. He did not say much but he was nodding along like he was evaluating me. Maybe I am reading into it. Probably I am reading into it. But I have been in enough rooms to know when someone is there to observe rather than participate.

Came home and Karen had dinner ready which was nice. She asked about my day and I gave her the short version. She said it sounded like a good opportunity. I agreed. We watched something on TV and I fell asleep on the couch before it ended. She put a blanket on me. I woke up at 2am still on the couch and went upstairs and she was already asleep. These are the kinds of things that keep happening and I am not sure either of us is noticing how much space there is between us now.

**Nudge:** "That blanket she put on you -- when did you two stop talking about the hard stuff?"

**Response:** We talk. Just not about the things that would require either of us to change something.

## Entry 10 - 2025-06-20

Finished the cutting board. Walnut with maple inlay, nothing fancy but the joints are tight. Rubbed it down with mineral oil and it looks good. Brought it inside and set it on the counter.

Karen picked it up and turned it over a few times. She said "You made this?" and I said yeah. She put it down and said "It's really beautiful, Gerry." Something about the way she said my name. Have not heard her say it like that in a long time.

## Entry 11 - 2025-06-24

Second task force meeting went better. I cut the charter down to four pages and proposed a two-week sprint to prototype something instead of planning for another month. The CTO seemed pleased. Raj was not there this time which helped. I could just run the room without wondering if I was being graded.

Chen came to me after the meeting and said he wants to transfer onto the task force. I was surprised. He has been underperforming on my reliability team but maybe that is because he does not care about reliability work. Maybe I have been measuring him against the wrong thing. I told him I would think about it but I think I am going to say yes.

Ordered more walnut and some cherry this time. Thinking about making a small side table next. Karen asked if she could watch me work in the garage sometime and I said sure. We are going to Portland together next weekend. Her idea but I said yes without hesitating which is new. The Options folder is still on my desktop. I have not opened it in two weeks. Not sure what that means yet but it does not bother me the way it probably should.
