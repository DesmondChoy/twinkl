## Entry 0 - 2025-11-05

Another sprint planning meeting where they want me to estimate the same maintenance tickets I have been doing for three years. I know exactly how long everything takes now. That is maybe the problem.

**Nudge:** "What's bothering you about knowing?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-11-11

The new architect they brought in, Jennifer, she wants to rewrite the payment gateway from scratch. Using Go instead of Java. Everyone in the room looked at me like I was supposed to object, since I built the original thing in 2019. But honestly? Part of me wanted to say yes, let us do it, let me learn something new instead of patching the same codebase forever.

I did not say that though. I said we should consider the timeline and the risk to the December release. Which is true. The business needs stability. But I walked out of that meeting feeling like I had swallowed something heavy.

**Nudge:** "You sided against yourself in there?"

**Response:** It is not that simple. Jennifer does not know what she does not know about the regulatory requirements. Someone had to be the adult.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-14

Elena surprised me with tickets to a tech conference in San Francisco next month. Not the corporate kind with vendor booths and networking bingo, but one of those unconference events where people just propose sessions in the morning and see what happens. She said she noticed I have been looking at conference websites lately but never registering for anything.

I should be excited. Five years ago I would have booked the flight before she finished her sentence. Now I am already thinking about the sprint commitments, about whether Marcus can handle the on-call rotation alone, about what my manager will say when I request the days off. The conference is on a weekend. I would only need to take Friday off. Still, I hesitated.

What bothers me most is not the hesitation itself. It is that I used to make decisions faster. Move to Austin? Two weeks to decide. Take the startup job over the stable bank position? One evening with Elena and a bottle of wine. Now I research, I weigh, I consider all stakeholders. My mother would say I finally grew up. But it feels more like something got dimmer.

I will go to the conference. I already told Elena yes. I just wish the yes had come easier.

**Nudge:** "When did decisions start feeling heavy?"

**Response:** Maybe around the time my father got sick. 2018. Suddenly there were consequences everywhere I looked. Every choice felt connected to whether I would be there, whether I was reliable. He passed in 2019 and I thought it would lift, but it did not. The weight just found new things to attach to.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-17

Long day. Production incident at 3 AM, the payment gateway again. Not the part Jennifer wanted to rewrite, ironically, but the legacy integration with the bank's SFTP server. I was on call so I got the page. Took four hours to trace it to a certificate expiration that nobody had on their calendar.

By 7 AM I had fixed it and documented everything. By 8 AM I was in the standup explaining what happened. By 9 AM I was getting messages from the VP asking how we let this happen. Not thank you for catching it. Not good job on the quick fix. Just how did we let this happen.

I did not let anything happen. I inherited this system. I have been asking for budget to modernize the certificate management for two years. But I did not say that either. I just said we would add better monitoring and put the renewal dates in a shared calendar. Safe answer. Team player answer.

Elena asked me at dinner why I looked so tired. I said work was busy. I did not tell her about the VP message because then she would get angry on my behalf and I would have to either agree with her anger or defend the company that made me feel small today. Both options felt exhausting.

I need to sleep but my mind keeps rehearsing the incident like I missed something. I did not miss anything. The certificate was not in any documentation I had access to. But I keep checking anyway.

**Nudge:** "You keep swallowing things down lately."

**Response:** Maybe I do. It is easier than the alternative. Every time I push back, I become the difficult one, the senior engineer who cannot adapt, the old guy who thinks he knows better. So I absorb it. I fix things quietly. I make myself small so the team can function. It is what my father did at his factory job for forty years. I used to think he was weak for that. Now I understand he was just tired.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-18

The morning after a bad night is always strange. Everything looks normal. Coffee tastes the same. I just feel like I am watching myself go through the motions from somewhere slightly outside.

**Nudge:** "What motions are you watching yourself do?"

**Response:** The usual routine. Checking Slack before I get out of bed. Reviewing the overnight alerts. Logging into the standup. Answering questions I have answered a hundred times. It is not bad, exactly. It is just automatic. Like I am not really needed there, just my pattern.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-22

Flew to San Francisco yesterday for the unconference. Staying at a hotel near the Embarcadero with a view of the bay. Weather is cold and gray but I brought my good jacket.

The conference format is interesting. You show up in the morning, people pitch sessions on index cards, everyone votes with stickers, and then the schedule emerges. No predetermined speakers, no approved slides. Someone proposed a session on rebuilding legacy systems with LLMs. Someone else wanted to discuss leaving tech after 50. I almost proposed something about maintaining software versus maintaining yourself, but I did not have the index card ready in time.

I attended four sessions. The legacy systems one was good, practical advice I could use. The leaving tech one was harder to sit through. A woman around my age talked about how she realized she had optimized her whole life for a company that laid her off in an afternoon. She cried a little. Everyone was respectful.

Tonight I walked along the waterfront instead of joining the dinner group. Watched the ferries come and go. Called my mother. She asked if I was eating well and I said yes, even though I had skipped lunch. Some lies are kindness.

Tomorrow is the last day. I feel different here. Not better or worse. Just different.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you with that index card?"

**Response:** I was still figuring out what I wanted to say. It felt too personal for a room of strangers. Maybe next time.

## Entry 6 - 2025-11-28

Back from the conference for a week now and people at work keep asking how it was. I say it was great, very inspiring, lots of good ideas. Which is true. But when they ask what I am going to do differently, I do not have a good answer. Learn Go? Propose a rewrite? Those feel like someone else's moves.

My manager suggested I do a lunch-and-learn to share what I learned. I said I would think about it. I probably will not do it. Public speaking was never my thing, and honestly, the sessions that meant most to me were the ones I cannot really present in a corporate setting. Nobody wants a slide deck about existential uncertainty in late-career engineers.

**Nudge:** "What did you actually bring back from there?"

**Response:** Some business card contacts. A reading list. The usual conference stuff.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-04

December sprint started with three people out sick and a scope increase nobody agreed to. I have been working ten-hour days trying to keep us on track for the holiday release. Jennifer is frustrated because her Go rewrite keeps getting deprioritized. I am frustrated because I am the one who has to explain why to her without making leadership look bad.

Had dinner with Elena's cousin Miguel who is visiting from Monterrey. He runs a small construction company there. He asked me about my job and I tried to explain sprint planning and stakeholder management and he just laughed and said it sounds like I spend a lot of energy managing people's feelings about work instead of actually working. He did not mean it unkindly but it stuck with me. Maybe he is right. Maybe that is what corporate software engineering becomes after a while.

**Nudge:** "What would actually working look like for you?"

**Response:** Building something. Seeing it run. Not writing status reports about why it is not done yet. But that is not realistic at my level, I suppose.

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-11

I finally did it. I proposed to my manager that I move to Jennifer's team for the Go rewrite project. Not as a lead, not as an architect. Just as a developer. Someone who writes code and learns the new language and maybe remembers what it felt like to not know everything about a codebase.

He looked at me like I had asked for a demotion. Which, technically, I had. He said he would need to think about it, talk to HR, consider the implications. He asked if everything was okay at home. I said yes, everything is fine, I just want to learn something new before I am too old to learn.

I do not know why I said it like that. I am not too old. But something in me wanted to say it out loud, the fear underneath. Like naming it would make it less powerful.

Elena was proud of me when I told her. She said she has been waiting for me to do something like this for years. I did not know she was waiting. I thought I was hiding the restlessness well enough. Apparently I was only hiding it from myself.

Now I wait to see what they decide. Maybe they say no and I stay in my maintenance role forever. Maybe they say yes and I flounder in a new language at 57. Both possibilities feel more alive than certainty.

## Entry 9 - 2025-12-16

They said yes. Contingent on finishing the holiday release first, but yes. I start on Jennifer's team in January. I have been studying Go tutorials at night, feeling like a student again.
