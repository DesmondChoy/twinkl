# Persona 9d126412: Kenneth Goh

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 9d126412
- **Name:** Kenneth Goh
- **Age:** 55+
- **Profession:** Manager
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Power
- **Bio:** Kenneth Goh is a 58-year-old senior operations manager at a Singaporean logistics conglomerate, where he has spent twenty-three years climbing from freight coordinator to overseeing a department of forty-five staff across three regional offices. He recently lost the promotion to Vice President of Operations to a younger colleague with an MBA from INSEAD, and has been quietly seething while maintaining a composed exterior at work. His wife runs her own small catering business and rarely defers to him on household finances the way his own mother deferred to his father, which grates on him in ways he does not fully admit. He chairs the residents' committee in his HDB estate and has made it his mission to push through a lobby renovation that several neighbors oppose.

## Entry 0 - 2025-09-22

Had a good run at the RC meeting tonight. The lobby renovation proposal has been stalling for months because of Uncle Tan and his little coalition of holdouts, but I came prepared this time. Pulled together three contractor quotes, a cost-per-household breakdown, a maintenance projection over ten years. Laid it all out on the whiteboard. Even Mrs. Lim, who has been sitting on the fence, nodded along when I showed the depreciation numbers.

The thing is, nobody else would have done this homework. They would have kept going back and forth at every meeting, complaining about the cracked tiles and the peeling paint, never actually resolving anything. I spent two weekends on those quotes. Called in a favor from a guy I know at a building management firm. That is how things get done — you do the legwork, you control the information, you set the direction.

When the vote came, it was seven to two. Uncle Tan and his friend held out but it did not matter. I kept my voice level, thanked everyone for attending, wrapped up in under ninety minutes. Walked home feeling like myself. Like the version of me that knows how to move a room. It has been a while since I felt that at the office.

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-29

Managed to restructure the KPI reporting template my department uses before the quarterly review — simplified it, made the data speak for itself instead of burying it in twelve different tabs the way Daniel's team does. My GM noticed during the meeting and called it "clean work." Not a big deal, just a moment where the right thing clicked into place.

**Nudge:** "What did 'clean work' from the GM mean to you?"

**Response:** It meant he still sees the difference between someone who knows how to run operations and someone who hides behind frameworks and buzzwords. That is all.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-02

Daniel presented my regional consolidation idea at the leadership sync this morning. Same structure, same three-phase approach I pitched to him informally two weeks ago over coffee. He did not credit me. I sat there, mouth half open, and just let it happen.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from saying something in that room?"

**Response:** Everyone was already nodding. If I spoke up it would have looked petty. Like the older guy clinging to credit. I know how that plays. So I sat there and smiled.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-09

The new procurement system rollout requires sign-off from Group IT before we can configure anything for our department. I submitted the request form nine days ago. Called James in IT twice, emailed once, even copied his manager. Got a reply today saying it is "in the queue" and they will "circle back next week."

Meanwhile my team is stuck running parallel processes on the old system, burning hours on manual reconciliation that should have been automated a month ago. I have done everything I can do. The bottleneck is not mine. But when the GM asks why we are behind on the migration timeline, it will be my name on the status report, not James's. Twenty-three years and I still have to sit and wait for a thirty-year-old IT coordinator to decide when my department gets to function properly.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-16

Had a disagreement with the GM over the warehouse staffing model. I have been running the weekend shift allocation the same way for eight years. It works. Attrition is low, the supervisors know the rotation, the overtime costs are predictable. Then Priscilla from HR comes in with a "flexible rostering" proposal that basically throws the whole structure out and lets staff bid on shifts through an app.

I told the GM this would cause chaos. You cannot run a warehouse floor on preferences. People need structure. You need to know who is where and when, and someone needs to own that decision. He listened, then said let us pilot Priscilla's model for one quarter and review. Just like that. Not even a counter — just "let's try it."

I could have pushed harder. I had the data, the history, the operational knowledge. But Priscilla had a slide deck with engagement scores and a Harvard Business Review citation, and I could feel the room tilting her way. So I said fine. I will support the pilot. Shook her hand after. My supervisor Michelle asked me later if I was okay with it. I told her it is what the GM wants, so we execute. That is the job. But I keep running the numbers in my head and I know this is going to cost us. When it does, I will be the one cleaning it up, not Priscilla.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-20

Sat through a two-hour leadership development workshop today. Mandatory for all senior managers. The facilitator — could not have been older than thirty-five — spent forty minutes explaining stakeholder mapping as if half the room had not been managing stakeholders since before she graduated. She asked me to share "a time when I had to earn buy-in from a resistant stakeholder." I gave a polished answer about the Suzhou warehouse relocation in 2019. She smiled and said "great example of vulnerability."

That is not what it was. It was an example of knowing when to push and when to wait, and reading a room of Chinese factory managers who were not going to respond to some consultant's empathy framework. I did not say that. I just nodded. I am too tired to fight these battles anymore. Every year there is a new person who thinks they can teach me how to do what I have been doing for two decades. And every year I sit in the chair and nod.

**Nudge:** "You've mentioned nodding along a few times now. What would it cost you to stop?"

**Response:** It is just a workshop. Not worth making a scene over. You pick your battles.

## Entry 6 - 2025-10-26

Quiet weekend. Mei Ling had a catering job Saturday so I was home alone most of the day. Made myself kaya toast and coffee for breakfast, read the Straits Times cover to cover. The downstairs coffeeshop uncle gave me an extra egg when I bought lunch, said I looked tired. I probably do.

Watched the F1 qualifying in the evening. Spent too long on a WhatsApp group chat with my army mates arguing about whether the new Tampines hawker centre is better than the old one. It is not, but Raymond insists. Fell asleep on the couch before the replay finished. Nothing remarkable. Just a day that passed the way days pass when nobody needs anything from you.

## Entry 7 - 2025-11-01

The quarterly results came out and Daniel's team got the spotlight again. His consolidation project — my idea, let us be honest — delivered a twelve percent reduction in cross-border processing time. The GM mentioned it in the town hall. Daniel stood up and talked about "collaborative innovation" and "cross-functional alignment." I was sitting in the third row watching him get applause for work that started in my head, over my coffee, in my office.

Nobody cut me off this time. Nobody had to. The story has already been written. He pitched it, he ran it, he gets the credit. And I sat there again, clapping politely, because that is what you do. My wife asked me tonight why I was in such a foul mood. I told her work was tiring. She said I should consider whether this job still gives me what I need. I nearly snapped at her. What does she know about what I need from this job. She runs a catering business out of our kitchen. This is a forty-five person operation across three countries.

But I did not say that. Because somewhere underneath the anger I know she might have a point. This used to be the place where I mattered. Where my decisions moved things. Now I sit in meetings and nod and watch younger people present my ideas and get called innovative. I am not sure what I am holding onto anymore. The title still says Senior Operations Manager. But it is starting to feel like a frame around an empty picture.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like if you stopped holding onto the title?"

**Response:** I do not know. That is the honest answer. I have been Kenneth-the-operations-guy for so long I am not sure there is another version underneath. And that thought is worse than the meetings.
