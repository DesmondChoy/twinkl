## Entry 0 - 2025-05-01

The studio smells like turpentine again because I forgot to cap the jar before I left yesterday. Spent six hours on the commission piece for that hotel lobby in Abdoun. Massive canvas, three meters wide, and the client wants "something that feels Middle Eastern but modern." I've heard that phrase so many times it's lost all meaning. I painted geometric patterns, scraped them off, painted loose abstractions over them, scraped those off too. Ended up with something layered that looks like a wall that's been lived on for decades. It might work. I'm too tired to tell.

Drove to the center after to set up for tomorrow's session. The hallway light is still broken so I propped the door open for daylight while I organized supplies. The kids went through all the blue paint last week so I picked up more on the way, the cheap kind because the good acrylics cost too much for how fast they use them. Counted the brushes. We're down to fourteen. I keep forgetting to ask Huda if the center can budget for more or if that's coming out of my pocket again.

The drive home was quiet. Ramadan traffic has died down, the streets were almost empty. I ate leftover mujaddara standing at the kitchen counter and went straight to bed. My shoulders ache from reaching up at the canvas all day. I should stretch more. I never do.

**Nudge:** "How often do you end up covering those costs yourself?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-06

Something happened at a dinner at my uncle's house on Friday that I'm still thinking about. His neighbor was there, an older man, very confident in his opinions. He started talking about the Sudanese workers at a construction site near his building. Calling them lazy, saying they were "bringing problems," that the government should stop giving them permits. The usual garbage. My aunt was nodding along. My cousin was on his phone, not paying attention. My uncle said nothing, which for him is the same as agreeing.

I sat there with my fork in my hand and I didn't say a single thing. I knew exactly what I wanted to say. That these men left everything behind and are breaking their bodies on scaffolding in forty-degree heat for wages that wouldn't cover his grocery bill. That my grandmother was a refugee once too. That the least we owe people who have lost their homes is not talking about them like they're pests at a dinner table. I had all of it ready and I just kept eating.

Part of it was exhaustion, I'd been at the studio since seven that morning. Part of it was knowing it wouldn't change his mind. But mostly I think I just didn't want the tension. I didn't want my aunt looking at me that way she does when I "make things difficult." I picked the easy thing. I've been carrying that around for days now and it doesn't feel lighter.

**Nudge:** "What kept you from saying it?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-11

Workshop today. One of the boys, Ahmad, who's maybe twelve, has been coming every week since January. He barely spoke for the first month, just painted the same image over and over, a grey building with no windows. Today he painted a garden. Green everywhere, flowers I don't think he's ever seen in real life, a yellow bird. He didn't say anything about it. He just held it up to dry and went to wash his brushes.

I didn't make a fuss. I just told him the yellow was a good choice and helped him find a spot on the drying rack. It was a small thing. But I drove home feeling like something had actually worked, not because of me specifically, just because the space existed for him to get there on his own. That felt right. I'm exhausted but it's the kind of tired I don't mind.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-11

Took the hotel commission money and spent it on new brushes for the studio instead of restocking the center's supplies like I'd planned. The kids need materials more than I need sable brushes. I know that and I did it anyway.

**Nudge:** "What made you choose the brushes?"

**Response:** I was standing in the art store and I was tired of always using the cheap ones. Just once I wanted something nice for myself.

My friend Dina made a joke at lunch about how the street cats near Jabal Amman "should all be rounded up." I know she doesn't really mean harm but it landed wrong and I just laughed along.

**Nudge:** "Why did you laugh?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-16

Went to the center early to set up before the kids arrived. I'd brought the sable brushes from my studio, the ones I bought with the hotel money. I put them out with the regular supplies and didn't say anything about it. Ahmad used one of them and you could see the difference in how the paint moved. He looked up at me like something had changed and I just shrugged.

Funny how that worked out. I spent four days feeling guilty about buying those brushes and then I brought them to the center anyway. Not because I'm generous or whatever, more because they were sitting in my studio and I kept thinking about fourteen kids sharing broken-handled acrylics. The brushes are just brushes. They belong where they get used. Walked home the long way, past the old city walls. The jasmine is blooming early this year.
