## Entry 0 - 2025-03-20

Had a call with Sami from the Aqaba branch about the delayed container shipments. Third time this month. He kept circling around the issue without giving me a straight answer about what went wrong on their end. I told him I need the incident report by Thursday and he agreed, but I could tell he was just saying what I wanted to hear.

Spent most of the afternoon reviewing Q1 numbers with Dina. She's been solid this quarter — her team's turnaround times are the best in the division. Told her I'd put her forward for the efficiency award at the next leadership meeting. She seemed surprised, which is odd. She should know she's earned it.

Picked up the girls from piano. Layla has her recital next week and she's been anxious about it — keeps saying she'll mess up the second movement. Sat with her after dinner and ran through the piece twice. She nailed it both times. She's better than she thinks she is but she won't believe me when I tell her.

**Nudge:** "What's actually going on in Aqaba?"

**Response:** Honestly I think Sami's lost control of his warehouse team. Two of his senior guys left in January and he promoted people who weren't ready. But if I say that out loud it becomes my problem to fix, and I've got enough on my plate.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-20

Second time opening this today. Just got off the phone with my mother. She wanted to know if Fadi is "settling in okay" which is her way of asking whether I'm watching out for him. He's fine. More than fine — he closed the Zarqa supplier deal on his own last week and didn't even tell anyone until the contract was signed. I called him into my office this morning to tell him I noticed. The look on his face. Like he didn't expect anyone in management to actually see what he's doing day to day.

That's the thing that gets me. I remember being twenty-seven at my first real job and my manager barely knew my name. I told myself if I ever ran a team I'd make sure people felt seen. Not in some corporate poster way but actually noticed. Fadi's doing good work and he should hear it from someone who matters in the building.

Noor texted me a photo of Rania's math test — ninety-eight percent. Already thinking about how to celebrate at dinner. Maybe we do kunafa from Abu Salem's.

**Nudge:** "Why does that matter so much to you?"

**Response:** Because nobody did it for me. I had to figure everything out alone when I started. My first manager couldn't even remember which project I was on. I just don't want that for people under me.

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-20

Got an email from HR about the VP role. They want me to "onboard" the new guy next week. Show him around, introduce him to the team leads. My team.

---

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-26

People keep asking me how I feel about the VP situation like they expect me to be bitter about it. I'm not bitter. The man hasn't started yet and I'm already being asked to hold his hand through orientation. Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it well because that's what professionals do and because everyone will be watching how I handle it.

Had the onboarding meeting today. His name is Khalil. MBA from London, five years at Maersk. He's polished. Asked good questions. I answered them thoroughly and introduced him to every team lead personally. Dina told me afterward she was impressed by how generous I was with my time. That word — generous. I don't know if that's what it was. I know how things work. The person who trains the new boss controls the narrative.

Fadi called me tonight to ask about a contract clause he wasn't sure about. Spent twenty minutes walking him through it. He thanked me three times. I told him to stop thanking me and just get it right.

**Nudge:** "Was it generous or strategic?"

**Response:** Both. I genuinely want the transition to go well for the company. But I'm not naive — if I'm the one who made Khalil's first week smooth, that positions me a certain way. I don't see anything wrong with that.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-30

Friday at home. Noor's at the clinic for a half day so I took the girls to Teta's house. My mother made mansaf and spent the whole lunch telling Rania she needs to eat more.

---

## Entry 5 - 2025-04-04

Khalil scheduled a "division alignment" meeting for Monday without telling me first. Found out from Dina who got the calendar invite. She assumed I already knew. I didn't. It's a small thing but it's the kind of small thing that tells you how someone sees the org chart.

Had lunch with Amjad from finance. He mentioned casually that there are rumors about restructuring — possibly merging operations and logistics under Khalil. I kept my face neutral but inside something tightened. I've built this team from twelve people to forty-two. The processes, the KPI framework, the vendor relationships — those are mine.

Came home and Noor could tell something was off. She asked and I said work stuff, the usual. She didn't push. She knows when to give me room. After the girls went to bed I sat on the balcony for a while thinking about what I'd actually do if they folded my division. Started going through my LinkedIn for the first time in months. Not seriously. Just looking.

**Nudge:** "How serious is the LinkedIn thing really?"

**Response:** It's not serious yet. I'm not updating my profile or messaging anyone. But I want to know what's out there in case I need to move fast. I refuse to be caught off guard.

## Entry 6 - 2025-04-05

Fadi came to me today looking shaken. Khalil pulled him into a meeting and started questioning the Zarqa deal — asking why procurement didn't go through the new approval workflow that apparently Khalil set up without consulting me or my team. Fadi didn't know what to say. He did everything by the book, by the process that existed when he closed the deal.

I went to Khalil's office and told him directly that if he's changing procurement workflows he needs to loop in operations first because my people are the ones executing these contracts. He smiled and said he appreciated the feedback. Appreciated the feedback. Like I'm filing a suggestion at a hotel.

I'm angry but what's worse is I feel like I let Fadi down. He came to me because he trusts me and I brought him into this company. I should have anticipated that Khalil would start making changes without understanding the existing structure. I should have shielded him from this. Now Fadi's second-guessing himself over a deal he should be proud of.

**Nudge:** "Could you have actually prevented that?"

**Response:** Probably not. Khalil was going to assert himself no matter what. But I could have warned Fadi, prepared him for the possibility that new leadership means new rules. I just didn't think it would happen this fast.

## Entry 7 - 2025-04-07

Layla asked me at breakfast why I've been "grumpy." I told her I wasn't grumpy, just busy. But she's right. I've been bringing it home and that's not fair to them.

---

## Entry 8 - 2025-04-13

The restructuring rumor turned out to be exactly that — a rumor. CEO called me in on Thursday and told me operations stays independent, reporting to him, same as before. He also said he relies on my institutional knowledge and wants me on the quarterly strategy committee starting next month. I nodded, said thank you, kept it professional. Walked out of his office and called Noor immediately.

Took the whole family to Abu Salem's on Friday night to celebrate — didn't tell the girls why, just said we deserved it. Fadi texted me that evening asking for advice on a lease negotiation for his apartment. Nothing to do with work. I spent thirty minutes on the phone with him going through the clauses. Noor rolled her eyes but she gets it. Family is family, even at nine p.m. on a Friday.
