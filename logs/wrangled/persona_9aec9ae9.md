# Persona 9aec9ae9: Maren Lindqvist

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 9aec9ae9
- **Name:** Maren Lindqvist
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** Western European
- **Core Values:** Self-Direction
- **Bio:** Maren left a promising career in graphic design three years ago when her daughter Astrid was born, a decision she made on her own terms despite her parents' visible disappointment. She runs a small Etsy shop selling hand-drawn Scandinavian-style prints from her apartment in Utrecht, fiercely protecting her morning hours before Astrid wakes for her creative work. Her husband Erik works long hours in finance, which suits her fine—she prefers figuring out the household her own way rather than negotiating every small decision.

## Entry 0 - 2025-09-07

I had a proper meltdown today, and I'm not even sorry about it. My mother-in-law came over for what was supposed to be a "quick visit" and ended up rearranging half my kitchen because apparently I was storing the spices wrong. Wrong! As if there's a universally correct way to store paprika. I didn't say anything at first, just watched her shuffle things around with that satisfied look on her face, and then something snapped. I told her, very calmly, that I'd prefer she asks before moving things in my home. She looked at me like I'd slapped her.

Erik called later and said she was upset, that I'd embarrassed her. Maybe I did. But this is my space. I've set it up the way that works for me, for Astrid, for our little morning routine where she "helps" me make breakfast by pointing at ingredients. It's taken me months to figure out a system that doesn't make me feel like I'm drowning in domestic chaos. And someone just walked in and decided she knew better.

I know she meant well. I know that. But meaning well isn't the same as respecting that I've built something here on purpose. Not by accident. On purpose.

**Nudge:** "What specifically about your system makes mornings work?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-11

Spent the whole morning on a commission that I probably should have turned down. A client wanted a custom piece—a mountain landscape in my style—but then kept sending "small suggestions" that were basically a different style entirely. Softer edges, she said. More realistic trees. At some point I had to ask myself: is this even my work anymore, or am I just a hand executing someone else's vision?

I did finish it, and she loved it. Paid extra, even. But sitting here now, looking at the file, I feel hollow about it. It's not bad. It's just not mine. And that distinction matters to me more than I sometimes admit.

There's a practical voice in my head that says income is income, especially since the shop has been slow this month. But there's another voice—louder, if I'm honest—that asks what the point is if I'm not making the things I actually want to make. I could have spent those hours on my own collection instead. I chose not to. For money. And now I'm sitting with that choice.

I don't regret it exactly. I just notice how it sits differently than the pieces I create for myself.

**Nudge:** "What would you have drawn for yourself those hours?"

**Response:** I've had this image in my head for weeks—a single figure standing at the edge of a frozen lake, back to the viewer, and the ice is cracking but in a pattern that looks almost like tree roots spreading. It's about choosing to step forward even when the ground feels unstable. I've sketched it twice but haven't committed to the full piece yet. That's what I would have worked on.

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-11

Astrid started saying "no" to everything today and honestly, same. I get it kid. Sometimes every option feels like the wrong one.

**Nudge:** "Which options?"

**Response:** Oh, nothing specific really. Just one of those days where even deciding what to make for dinner feels like too much. Probably just tired.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-17

Erik brought up the idea of Astrid starting daycare two days a week. He framed it as giving me more time for the shop, which sounds supportive, but I could hear the subtext loud and clear: he thinks I'm not managing well. Or that I'm wasting time. Or both.

And maybe I am struggling some days. Maybe there are afternoons where Astrid naps and I just sit on the couch scrolling instead of working on prints. But that's my choice to make. I'm the one here every day. I know what I need. Some days I need to create. Some days I need to rest. And I don't need someone who's at an office until 7pm deciding what my schedule should look like.

I know daycare isn't a punishment. Plenty of parents do it, and their kids are fine, great even. It's not about whether daycare is good or bad. It's about this being my decision, about my time, about my daughter—and it wasn't offered as an option. It was presented as a solution to a problem I didn't say I had.

I told him I'd think about it. But I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be thinking about. Whether to accept having my days restructured for me?

**Nudge:** "What would need to be different for daycare to feel like your idea?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-17

Later the same day now, after Erik and I talked again. Astrid's finally asleep. I'm on the couch with a glass of wine that I'm too tired to actually drink.

We didn't fight, exactly. He backed off the daycare thing, said he just wanted to help. And I believe him. But I still feel weird. Like I have to defend choices I make in my own home. Like staying home with my daughter and running my shop is something that requires justification.

My mother worked full-time, same as my dad. They split everything 50/50, very modern, very practical. When I told them I was going to stay home after Astrid was born, they didn't say it was wrong, but they didn't say it was right either. Just... nothing. And Erik's family has a stay-at-home mom who followed rules and schedules I can't even fathom. Neither model fits me. I'm not building my life based on their blueprints.

I'm so tired of feeling like I'm doing this wrong no matter which direction I lean. I'm doing it my way. That's supposed to be enough.

**Nudge:** "What does your way actually look like tomorrow?"

**Response:** Tomorrow I'll wake up at 5:30 before Astrid, make coffee, and spend an hour on the frozen lake piece before she's up. Then we'll do breakfast together—she helps me pick which fruit to cut. After lunch when she naps, I'll work on shop orders or answer emails, depending on what feels right in that moment. Maybe I'll take a walk with her in the late afternoon to the park she likes. Erik comes home, I hand off, and the evening is mine. That's it. That's my way. Flexible but intentional.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-21

Sold three prints today from my original collection, not commissions. Actual things I made because I wanted to make them. It's not life-changing money but it's proof that what I create on my own terms has value to someone else too.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-24

Astrid poured yogurt on the cat today. I should have been faster but honestly I was sketching in my head and didn't notice she'd climbed onto the counter. We're all learning I guess.

**Nudge:** "What are you learning?"

**Response:** That I can't always be in two places at once. That some moments require my full presence and others can bend a little. That the cat will forgive us. That my brain doesn't shut off just because I'm watching a toddler, and maybe that's okay—maybe even necessary for my sanity.

## Entry 7 - 2025-09-28

I got an email today from my old agency in Amsterdam. They're doing a freelance project and apparently thought of me. Just a small illustration job, a few days of work, good pay. The catch is I'd need to come into the office for meetings, which means finding childcare for Astrid those days.

I've been staring at the email for three hours. Part of me wants to jump at it—prove that I'm still a real designer, that staying home hasn't erased my skills. Another part feels sick at the thought of slotting back into someone else's schedule, their briefs, their revisions cycle. And then there's the practical part doing math on whether the pay is even worth the hassle of arranging care.

What's strange is how guilty I feel about even considering it. Like wanting something outside of motherhood and my little shop is some kind of betrayal. But also guilty about not wanting it enough. Because shouldn't I be excited? Shouldn't a part of me miss that world?

I don't know what I want. That's the honest answer. I don't know what I want and I hate not knowing.

**Nudge:** "If you knew no one would judge either choice, which way do you lean?"

**Response:** Honestly? I lean toward saying no. Not because I'm scared or because it's too hard, but because the thought of sitting in their office making small talk about clients and deadlines makes me feel heavy. I left that for a reason. I don't miss it. I just sometimes miss being seen as competent by people who aren't related to me.

## Entry 8 - 2025-10-01

I said no to the Amsterdam job. Wrote the email this morning, polite but clear. And then I finished the frozen lake piece. Both in the same hour, which feels meaningful somehow.

Looking at the finished illustration, I'm struck by how much of me is in it. The figure on the ice—that's not some generic person, it's me, the version of me that's still learning to trust her own footing. The cracks spreading like roots—that's about how breaking apart can also be growing. I don't think anyone buying it will see all that. But I know, and that's what makes it feel real.

I've been thinking about what makes work meaningful to me. It's not the money, though money is necessary. It's not even external recognition, though that's nice. It's whether I can look at something and see my own choices reflected back. When I was at the agency, every project was filtered through client needs, brand guidelines, stakeholder feedback. The work was often beautiful. But it wasn't mine. And that matters to me in a way I've stopped apologizing for.

Astrid pointed at the print today and said "lady cold." Accurate assessment, kid.

**Nudge:** "What would it look like to fully trust your footing?"

**Response:** I think it would look like not second-guessing myself when Erik or my parents or anyone else offers an alternative path. Not because their ideas are bad, but because I'd be so secure in mine that I could hear them out without feeling threatened. Right now I still get defensive. Fully trusting would mean being curious instead—hearing what they suggest and knowing I can take it or leave it without my whole sense of direction wobbling.

## Entry 9 - 2025-10-03

Listed the frozen lake piece on the shop this morning. Set the price higher than usual because it took more out of me and I want that reflected. Someone already messaged asking if I do bulk orders for offices. I said no.

Also enrolled Astrid in a parent-toddler art class on Thursday mornings. It was my idea, on my timeline. That distinction matters. She'll get to smash paint around with other kids and I'll get to see if I can stand being around other parents for two hours.

## Entry 10 - 2025-10-09

The frozen lake piece sold. To a woman in Berlin who said it reminded her of a choice she made years ago. That's exactly what I wanted—something made from my experience resonating with someone else's. This is why I do this.

**Nudge:** "What choice do you think she saw in it?"

**Response:** I'll never know for certain, but I imagine it was a moment when she had to move forward without knowing if the ground would hold. Maybe leaving something—a job, a relationship, a place. The piece is about that threshold between safety and the unknown, and how stepping forward is both terrifying and necessary. If she saw that, then I managed to put something true into the world that found someone else who recognized it. That's the whole point, isn't it? Making something alone that connects to someone you've never met.
