Board approved the new distribution hub in Monterrey. I'll be flying up there twice a month starting in August to oversee the build-out. Finally something different on the calendar.

**Nudge:** "Twice a month to Monterrey—are you relieved or just restless?"

**Response:** Restless, if I'm honest. The office routine was starting to feel like wearing a shirt that's too tight. Even the commute, the same faces at the same intersections. Monterrey gives me something to look forward to.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-30

First scouting trip to Monterrey was yesterday—flew in early, drove around the industrial park, met with the contractor, walked the empty warehouse space. The floor was just concrete and dust and that particular echo you get in big empty buildings. Something about it felt like possibility. Like the first page of a notebook.

Had dinner at a little place the contractor recommended, carnitas that reminded me of a trip I took to Michoacán twenty years ago. Called Lucía from the hotel balcony and told her about the mountains visible from the site. She said she might come on the next trip. That made the whole day feel complete.

**Nudge:** "Would having Lucía there change how you experience it?"

**Response:** Probably. She notices things I miss. But honestly I was just glad she's interested—she's been busy with her own work lately and I wasn't sure she'd want to. Anyway, the site is the main thing right now.

Back in the office. Same view from my desk. Already counting days until the next Monterrey trip.

**Nudge:** "What's so unbearable about the view from your desk?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-03

My nephew Tomás visited for lunch today. He's 28, just got promoted at the same insurance company where he started as an intern six years ago. Same company, same building, probably the same lunch spot every day. He was showing me photos from his vacation—Cancún, the same resort his parents always went to—and talking about his ten-year plan. A house in the suburbs. Maybe a cabin somewhere for weekends.

I nodded and said the right things but inside I felt this churning. Not judgment exactly, more like... incomprehension? How does someone his age already know where they want to be in ten years? When I was 28 I was on my third city and had just quit a job because my boss wanted me to specialize.

He asked me for career advice. I didn't know what to say. What works for me would be terrible advice for him. "Keep moving" doesn't help someone who wants to stay put. So I told him to trust himself, which felt hollow. The whole conversation left me feeling like I'm from a different species.

Lucía says Tomás reminds her of her brother, who's very happy with his predictable life. Maybe that's true. Maybe I'm the odd one. But walking back to the office after lunch, the city felt gray even though the sun was out.

**Nudge:** "The gray city—is that about Tomás or something else?"

**Response:** Both, probably. I don't know. Sometimes I think I'm allergic to contentment, if that makes sense. Never mind, it's probably just that I need another coffee.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-10

Someone at the board meeting asked if I'm "committed to staying" with the company through the Monterrey project. As if my track record of getting things done isn't enough. I've never left a project half-finished in my life.

**Nudge:** "But you've thought about leaving, haven't you?"

**Response:** Of course I have. I always think about what's next. That doesn't mean I'll leave before the work is done. They're two different things. The question just felt like an accusation.

Took Lucía dancing last night at that new salsa club in Condesa. We stayed until 1am. Good reminder that variety doesn't always require a boarding pass.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-17

My brother called to tell me our father's old house in Guadalajara sold. He implied I should feel sad about it. I don't. It was just a building—the memories are in my head, not in the walls.

**Nudge:** "Does it bother you that it doesn't bother you?"

**Response:** A little, actually. Everyone else in the family seems to treat places like anchors. I've always treated them like way stations. Sometimes I wonder if I'm missing something they feel, or if I just feel it differently.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-20

Third trip to Monterrey. The warehouse walls are up now. I stood where the loading dock will be and watched trucks pass on the highway. Different view from two weeks ago.

**Nudge:** "What does it feel like, watching something you started take shape?"

**Response:** Good. It feels good. Though honestly, this phase—when it's under construction—is always my favorite part. Once it's running smoothly, that's when I start getting restless again. But that's a problem for later.

## Entry 8 - 2025-08-26

Long day. Flight delayed, then a three-hour meeting about supply chain redundancies that felt like it could have been an email. Sat through presentation after presentation about backup plans and contingencies and worst-case scenarios. Everyone nodding seriously.

I get it. Redundancy is important. Contingencies save companies. But my God, the energy in that room was like a waiting room at a dentist's office. No one asked what opportunities we might be missing, what new routes we could try, what experiments might be worth running. Just risk, risk, risk, mitigation, mitigation, mitigation.

Came back to the hotel and just sat on the bed for twenty minutes without moving. Not tired exactly—more like deflated. Lucía texted asking how it went and I didn't know how to answer. "Fine" felt like a lie but "soul-crushing" felt dramatic. Said "long" and left it at that.

She's meeting me here tomorrow for the weekend. We're going to drive up to a canyon she read about. That's what I'm holding onto right now.

**Nudge:** "Is the canyon trip rescuing you or just postponing something?"

**Response:** Rescuing. Definitely rescuing. I don't think there's anything to postpone—the meetings are what they are, I just need something to balance them out. The canyon is balance. Lucía is balance. Without those counterweights I'd probably quit every job within six months.

The canyon was worth it. We drove two hours on winding roads, stopped at a mirador where you could see layers of rock going back millions of years. Lucía had brought a picnic—tortas and fruit and those little marzipan candies I like. We sat there for an hour just watching shadows move across the canyon walls.

On the drive back she asked me what I wanted to do when I retire. I laughed and said "not retire." But she pressed, and I tried to actually think about it. What would I do if I didn't have to work?

I think I'd travel. Not vacation-travel but exploratory travel—learn a language, live somewhere for a few months, move on. Maybe write about what I see. The problem is, I've been saying some version of that for thirty years, and somehow there's always another project, another opportunity, another reason to stay in the game a little longer.

Lucía said she'd come with me. She wasn't being hypothetical—she was offering. That felt like something. I'm still thinking about it.

## Entry 10 - 2025-08-31

Performance reviews this week. I gave mostly good feedback to my team, but one conversation stuck with me. Daniela, one of the younger project coordinators, asked me how I've "stayed motivated for so long." The way she said it made me sound like some kind of marathon runner who refuses to stop.

I told her the truth—that I've never felt like I was running a marathon. More like a series of sprints toward interesting things. She looked confused. I tried to explain that what keeps me going is that each project, each challenge, feels genuinely different, even when the surface looks similar. The Monterrey hub isn't like anything I've done before because the people are different, the problems are different, the city is different. She nodded but I could tell she didn't quite get it.

Later I wondered if I was making sense or just rationalizing. Maybe to someone like Daniela, who's building expertise in one domain, my approach looks scattered. Maybe it is scattered. My brother would say so—he's been with the same company for twenty-five years and can't understand why I don't value that kind of depth.

But when I think about doing one thing for twenty-five years, I feel a kind of panic. Not fear exactly, more like suffocation. Is that a character flaw or just how I'm wired? I've never been able to answer that question. Maybe it doesn't matter as long as I'm still curious about what comes next.

**Nudge:** "What would change if you decided it's just how you're wired?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe nothing. Maybe I'd stop second-guessing myself every time someone looks at me like I'm an alien for not wanting to settle down. Or maybe the second-guessing is part of the wiring too. Anyway, the Monterrey hub opens in October. That's what matters right now.
