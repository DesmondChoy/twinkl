## Entry 0 - 2025-12-11

Sat in the parking garage after class for probably twenty minutes before I could make myself drive home. Stats exam went okay I think, but my brain is just done. Got a text from my sister right after saying Mom had a rough morning and kept asking where Dad was. He's been gone eleven years. Lisa sounded wrecked on the phone. I told her I'd come up this weekend to give her a break.

Now I'm staring at a stack of reading for my practicum seminar and all I can think about is whether I should have moved back to Duluth instead of doing this degree. Some days this all feels like a selfish detour when the people who need me are somewhere else.

**Nudge:** "What makes it feel selfish to you?"

**Response:** Because Lisa's up there handling everything alone while I'm down here highlighting textbooks. She didn't sign up for that. We were supposed to figure out Mom's care together and instead I enrolled in a program. I keep telling myself this degree will help me help more people long-term but honestly? Right now it just means I'm not there when my mother doesn't recognize her own daughters.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-17

Drove up to Duluth Friday night after my last class. Lisa looked thinner than the last time I saw her, which was only three weeks ago. She's not eating enough. I spent Saturday doing Mom's laundry and sitting with her while Lisa went to get her hair done, which she hasn't done in months.

Mom was calm most of the day. She called me by my name twice, which felt like a gift. We looked through old photos and she remembered the cabin in Brainerd. Small things, but they matter. I made a big pot of chicken wild rice soup and left enough in Lisa's freezer for a week. It's the least I can do when I can't be there every day.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-17

My cohort advisor emailed about missing a group meeting last Friday. I was in Duluth taking care of my mother. Some things are more important than a Zoom call. I'll make it up but I'm not going to apologize for being there.

**Nudge:** "What's it like juggling those two worlds?"

**Response:** It's fine, I manage. People do harder things. The advisor is understanding, I'm probably overreacting because I'm tired from the drive.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-24

Christmas Eve and I'm wrapping presents at the kitchen table while Tyler's on the couch watching something on his phone. He's been quiet lately. I asked him if he was okay and he said yeah, just stressed about early decision. He applied to UW-Madison and won't hear back until February.

I keep wanting to fix it for him. Check his portal, email admissions, do something. But he's seventeen and he needs to learn to sit with uncertainty. That's the hardest part of caring about someone, I think. Knowing when to step back. I'm not very good at it. I'd rather stay up all night worrying on someone's behalf than let them worry alone. I don't know if that's love or just a habit I can't break.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-28

Weird thing happened today. I was reading for my human development course, this chapter about attachment theory and caregiving patterns, and I just started crying at the kitchen table. Tyler walked in and asked what was wrong and I said nothing, just allergies, which is such a mom thing to say and we both knew it was a lie.

The chapter was about how some people develop their identity almost entirely around being needed by others. How it starts in childhood, usually with a parent who needed caretaking themselves, and it becomes this pattern where you feel most yourself when you're giving to someone else. And I'm sitting there with a highlighter in my hand thinking, this is literally my biography.

I called Lisa after Tyler went to bed. Told her about the chapter and she laughed and said yeah, no kidding, you've been like that since you were ten. She reminded me how I used to make lunches for both of us when Mom was going through her rough patches. I was in fourth grade. I don't remember it as a burden though. I remember feeling useful. Important, even.

I guess what's getting to me is wondering whether I chose social work because I genuinely want to help people or because I literally don't know how to exist without someone to take care of. That's a scary thought to put on paper. But my practicum supervisor keeps saying self-awareness is the first tool, so here it is. I'm aware. Now what.

**Nudge:** "Does it have to be one or the other?"

**Response:** Maybe not. Lisa said something similar, that both things can be true. That I can genuinely care about this work and also recognize the pattern. I just don't want to end up burning out because I never learned how to sit still without a to-do list for someone else. I watched that happen with Mom before she got sick. She ran herself ragged for everyone and then there was nobody left to run for her.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-28

After that breakdown earlier I decided to actually be productive. Finished the attachment theory chapter and three of the discussion questions. Emailed my practicum site to confirm January hours. Called Mom's memory care coordinator to check in on the transition plan for when she needs more support, which might be sooner than we thought based on what Lisa's been describing.

The coordinator said they have a spot opening up in the assisted living wing in February. Lisa and I need to talk about it. It would take the daily pressure off Lisa but Mom would hate it. She still has enough awareness to know she's being moved, and I think that would devastate her. But Lisa can't keep doing this alone and I can't move back to Duluth right now, not with one semester left.

Made a list of things to handle this week: Tyler's FAFSA, my spring course registration, groceries for New Year's, and calling the insurance company about Mom's coverage changes. Also need to pick up Lisa's Christmas gift, which I completely forgot to order. She wanted that weighted blanket. I'll find one at Target tomorrow.

I noticed I feel calmer after making the list. That's the pattern again, isn't it. Anxiety happens and I make a list of ways to help other people and suddenly I can breathe. At least I can see it now even if I can't stop it.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-02

Lisa just told me she's thinking about taking a leave from her job to handle Mom full-time. She can't afford that. I should be the one doing this but I'm stuck here finishing a degree that doesn't pay anyone's bills yet.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-07

Had a long phone call with Lisa last night. We talked for almost two hours, which we haven't done in months because usually our calls are logistics. Where's the insurance card, did you call the pharmacy, can you come up this weekend. But this time we actually talked.

She told me she doesn't resent me for going back to school. I didn't realize how much I needed to hear that until she said it and I couldn't talk for a minute. She said she's proud of me, which made me feel about six years old in the best way. Then she said she's also exhausted and scared and doesn't know how long she can keep doing the day-to-day with Mom by herself.

We made a plan. I'll come up every other weekend starting this month, and we're going to look into the assisted living option together. Not making any decisions yet, just touring the place and talking to Mom's doctor. Lisa also said she wants me to stop apologizing every time we talk. She said, "You're doing what you need to do. Stop acting like you're abandoning us." I wrote that on a sticky note and put it on my laptop.

Tyler overheard part of the conversation and came in after to ask if Grandma was okay. I told him the truth, that she's not getting better but we're figuring it out as a family. He said he'd come with me to Duluth next time. He didn't have to offer that. Moments like that make me think I must have done something right with him.

**Nudge:** "What did it feel like to hear Lisa say she's proud of you?"

## Entry 8 - 2026-01-09

A classmate in my cohort made a comment during seminar about how people who go into social work are usually "working out their own stuff." She said it like it was a joke but half the room went quiet. I wanted to say something but I just sat there. She's twenty-six and has never had to take care of anyone but herself.

That's not fair, I don't know her story. But it bothered me more than it should have. Maybe because I know she's not wrong, at least in my case. But there's a difference between understanding your own patterns and having some kid with no life experience reduce your entire motivation to a punchline. I'm here because I've lived this. That counts for something.

**Nudge:** "You said she's not wrong. What part felt true?"

**Response:** The part about working out your own stuff, obviously. But everyone does that. Every doctor who lost a parent to cancer, every teacher who had a bad one growing up. That's not a weakness, that's fuel. I just didn't appreciate the delivery.

## Entry 9 - 2026-01-12

Drove up to Duluth Saturday morning. Tyler came with me. He sat with Mom for an hour while Lisa and I toured the assisted living wing. It's clean, the staff seemed attentive, there's a garden area for warmer months. Mom would have a private room.

Lisa and I agreed we'll bring it up with Mom's doctor at the next appointment. Neither of us said it out loud but we both know this is probably happening in the next few months. On the drive home Tyler was quiet. Then he said, "She remembered my name today." I just reached over and squeezed his hand.

Made it home by eight. Did laundry, packed Tyler's lunch for Monday, prepped my notes for practicum. Ordinary things that felt good to do.

## Entry 10 - 2026-01-17

Spring semester started. First class back and I actually felt ready. Not fixed, not finished figuring anything out. Just present. Lisa texted me good luck this morning with a heart emoji. I saved it.
