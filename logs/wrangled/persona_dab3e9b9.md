Had Christmas dinner at my sister's place. Her husband started going off about how the city shouldn't be spending money on the new refugee housing project downtown. I just sat there and ate my mashed potatoes. Didn't say a word.

**Nudge:** "Why mashed potatoes instead of pushing back?"

**Response:** It's Christmas. Nobody wants that fight at the table.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-31

Last day of the year and I keep circling back to a decision I made this week. One of our suppliers offered me a deal on cheaper filter components — significantly cheaper, like enough to actually turn a real profit for once. The catch is they source from a factory in Guangzhou that I've seen flagged in two separate reports for dumping chemical waste into a river that feeds into local farmland. The reports aren't conclusive. There's plausible deniability. The factory passed its last audit.

I said yes. I placed the order Tuesday morning and I've felt off about it ever since. I keep telling myself it's pragmatic, that if the business goes under then nobody gets clean water from us, not the communities we donate to, nobody. You can't do good work if you can't keep the lights on. That's not wrong. But it also feels like exactly the kind of reasoning I used to hear from the guys at my old company when they were justifying selling marked-up devices to underfunded hospitals.

I don't know where the line is anymore. When I started this thing I thought I'd always know. Turns out running a mission-driven company doesn't protect you from making the same compromises as everyone else. It just makes you feel worse about them.

**Nudge:** "You compared yourself to the guys at your old company. Does that comparison feel fair?"

**Response:** Probably not entirely. But the fact that I even made the connection bothers me.

## Entry 2 - 2026-01-03

Spent the morning going through invoices and realized we've burned through most of the Q1 budget already. The donation program is the biggest cost center and I know if I paused it for two quarters we'd actually be in the black for the first time since launch. My accountant has said this exact thing to me three times now. She's not wrong about the math.

Then I got an email from this woman in Flint — not even Flint proper, a small town forty minutes outside it — who got one of our units last spring. She said her daughter stopped getting rashes after they switched to our filter. Just a plain email, no dramatics. "I wanted you to know it's working. Thank you." That's it.

So no, I'm not pausing the donations. I'll figure out the money some other way. I always do, or I don't, and then I scramble and stress and eat takeout for a month. But I read that email and the spreadsheet argument just fell apart. I don't know how to explain that to my accountant. She'd probably say I'm being emotional. Maybe I am.

## Entry 3 - 2026-01-08

Went to the supplier meeting in Salem this morning about the spring distribution schedule. Drove past the reservation in Warm Springs on the way back — we installed twelve units there last October. Stopped in because I had time.

The community liaison, a guy named David, showed me around. The units are all still working. One family had rigged up an extra line to feed their greenhouse, which technically voids the warranty but honestly it was clever and I told him we'd look at a garden attachment for the next version. He laughed and said they'd already been thinking about that.

I left feeling steady. Not triumphant or anything close to it. Just like I was doing the thing I set out to do, in the specific place I set out to do it. The filters are filtering. The water is clean. David's family is using it to grow tomatoes in January. Sometimes the small evidence is enough to keep going. Drove home listening to the radio and didn't think about the budget once.

**Nudge:** "What was different about today compared to the spreadsheet stress last week?"

**Response:** Last week was numbers on a screen. Today was a guy growing tomatoes with clean water. Hard to argue with tomatoes.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-12

Monday. Spent most of the day on logistics for the next batch of donation units. Coordinating shipping to three different sites in the Midwest and one in Appalachia. The Appalachia contact is a retired teacher who started a community health initiative out of her garage. She sends me handwritten letters, which I keep in a folder in my desk drawer. I should probably digitize them but there's something about the paper.

Had a call with my business partner, Lena, about the website redesign. She wants to add customer testimonials. I said fine but I don't want it to feel like we're using people's water problems as marketing copy. She said that's exactly what it is, and that's okay because it's also true. We went back and forth for twenty minutes and landed on letting people opt in to share their stories rather than us asking. Felt like the right call.

Ate leftover Thai food for dinner. Called my mom. She asked when I'm coming to visit and I said maybe February but I know I probably won't make it. Ordered new packing tape because we ran out. That's about it.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-13

Canceled the order with the Guangzhou supplier. Found a domestic alternative that costs more but I can actually sleep now. Margins will be tight for a while.

**Nudge:** "What finally tipped it?"

**Response:** I just couldn't stop thinking about it. Sometimes that's enough.
