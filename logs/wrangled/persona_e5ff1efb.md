Christmas holiday but the school WhatsApp group is still buzzing with admin sending schedule reminders. Ignored all of it. Spent the morning working on the creative writing syllabus instead—finally nailed down the module on personal narratives. Used that Chimamanda essay collection I've been sitting on for months.

Ma called to ask if I'd "at least consider" the biodata from that engineer in Pune. Told her I'm not doing the arranged meeting circuit right now, I have actual work to do. She did her disappointed sigh thing but didn't push. Small victory.

The thing is, people act like I'm being difficult when I say I want to figure out my own path. But today felt right. I mapped out exactly how I want this program to run, on my terms. No committee approval needed because it's extracurricular. That's the whole point—I carved out a space where nobody gets to tell me what works and what doesn't. If Principal Mehta wants to be involved later, fine, but the vision is mine.

Rohan texted asking if I wanted to join the cousins for drinks. Didn't go. Needed this time alone with my ideas. Maybe that makes me antisocial but I genuinely don't care right now.

Back to lesson prep. The regular curriculum stuff—grammar worksheets, comprehension passages. Mind-numbing but has to be done before term starts.

Had chai with Ananya in the evening. She's dealing with wedding planning stress (March date confirmed) and wanted to vent about caterers. Listened mostly. She asked about the writing program and seemed genuinely interested, which was nice. Said she wished she had something like that when she was in school.

## Entry 2 - 2026-01-01

New year. Ma insisted on temple visit in the morning, then the extended family lunch happened. Usual scene—aunties asking about marriage, uncles making jokes about my "career phase." Nodded through most of it.

Uncle Vijay pulled me aside to say he knows someone at a CBSE school in Delhi with "excellent growth prospects" and would I be interested. Government affiliated, good pension, stable. Everything I specifically walked away from. Told him I'm happy where I am. He looked at me like I'd said something strange.

What bothers me is that I couldn't fully explain why. In the moment I just wanted to get away from the conversation. But it's not just about being stubborn. I chose this path. The after-school program, the flexibility to try new things in class, the fact that I can actually experiment—that's worth something. Worth more than a pension honestly.

But sitting here now, I wonder if I should have pushed back harder instead of just... retreating. Like, made him understand instead of just escaping the conversation. I sort of feel like I let myself down by not articulating it better.

**Nudge:** "What would you have wanted to say to him?"

## Entry 3 - 2026-01-03

Term starts Monday. Spent the day at school setting up classroom—put up the new bulletin board with student work from last term, rearranged desks into that U-shape configuration I like for discussions. The janitor looked at me weird but helped anyway.

Thinking about the first week back. Class 9 will be fine, they're used to my style by now. Class 7 might be tricky—new batch, they came from a very traditional English teacher before me, lots of rote learning. Going to have to ease them into actual discussion.

Also the creative writing program. Need to finalize the registration process. Was thinking maybe just a simple Google form, keep it informal. But then if it gets popular I might need to actually track attendance and all that. Ugh, the admin side of things. Part of me wants to just keep it casual and let kids show up when they want, but that might not fly with the school if they ever want to formalize it.

Ordered biryani for dinner. Treating myself since the real work starts again soon. Ma called twice, didn't pick up. Will call her tomorrow when I have the energy.

**Nudge:** "What's the worst that happens if you keep it casual?"

**Response:** Probably nothing honestly. Mehta doesn't pay attention to extracurriculars unless parents complain. I should just stop overthinking.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-04

First day back was fine. The Class 7 kids are shy but one girl—Meera—actually raised her hand without being called on. Asked if we'd be reading any poetry this term. Told her yes, we have Kamala Das on the syllabus. She looked excited. Those moments make it worth it.

But then the staff meeting happened. Principal Mehta going on about board exam prep and standardized assessments and how we need to "align" better with the other schools in the trust. Forty-five minutes of jargon. I could feel my eyes glazing over.

Here's what I keep circling back to: I know I'm a good teacher. The kids respond, they engage, they actually want to be in class. But in these meetings I feel like a fraud because I'm not doing what everyone else is doing. They're all talking about test scores and I'm thinking about how to get the kids to care about what they're reading.

And the thing is, I believe I'm right. I believe my approach matters. But when you're sitting in a room full of people nodding along to metrics and "learning outcomes," it's hard not to feel like maybe you're the one who's missing something.

I guess I'm just tired. It's only day one.

**Nudge:** "Do you actually think you're missing something, or does the room just make you feel that way?"

**Response:** The room definitely. When I'm with my students I know exactly what I'm doing. Meetings just bring out this performative anxiety or something.

Good teaching day. The Class 9 debate on whether social media is ruining language went better than expected—even the quiet ones participated. This is why I do this.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-12

Furious right now. Just got off the phone with Ma and I need to write this down before I explode.

She forwarded me a LinkedIn profile. An ENGINEER from her friend's son's network who "seems compatible" based on absolutely nothing. When I told her I wasn't interested, she started crying. Actual tears. Said she's worried I'm "throwing my life away" by being so "particular about everything."

Particular. Like wanting to choose my own life partner is some unreasonable demand. Like deciding to leave a government job to do work that actually means something is being difficult.

I told her I'd call her back when I was calmer. She said "don't bother, you never listen anyway." So that's where we are now.

The thing that really gets me is that she knows. She knows I'm happy with my work. She's seen me come home excited about a lesson that went well. She visited the school during last year's annual day and saw the kids perform the scenes we'd been working on for months. She hugged me after and said she was proud.

But somehow that doesn't count? Somehow I'm still failing at life because I'm 29 and single and not in a government job with a pension?

I don't know how to make her understand that I need to do things my own way. I've tried explaining it. Maybe I need to just accept that she'll never get it.

**Nudge:** "Is that actually what you want though—her just not getting it forever?"

**Response:** No, obviously not. But what's the alternative? I can't change who I am to make her comfortable.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-17

Creative writing program had its first session today. Seven kids showed up, which is more than I expected honestly. Mix of classes 8-10. We did a freewriting exercise and then shared—nobody had to but four of them volunteered.

One boy, Arjun, wrote about his grandmother's hands. Just this vivid little piece about how she makes rotis and the way she hums while she works. Nothing fancy but so specific and real. I told him it was beautiful and he got embarrassed but also clearly pleased.

This is the thing I built. Mine. Nobody assigned it to me or approved a budget or gave me a template to follow. I figured out what I wanted to create and I made it happen. Finally something that feels fully mine in this job.

Second creative writing session done. Ten kids this time—word is spreading. Meera from Class 7 joined and already has a notebook full of poems she wanted to show me.
