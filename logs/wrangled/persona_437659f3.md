He finds meaning in providing stability for his family while grappling with his concerns about the world his children will inherit—climate change, inequality, and social fragmentation weigh on him. He volunteers at a local food bank when possible and tries to model empathy and environmental awareness for his kids, though the daily demands of parenting often leave him exhausted.
