## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 5943c186
- **Name:** Layla Haddad
- **Age:** 35-44
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** Middle Eastern
- **Core Values:** Hedonism
- **Bio:** Layla lives in Amman with her husband Tariq and their two children, ages six and nine. She left a marketing role five years ago when the family decided one parent should be home full-time, and she chose it partly because she wanted mornings without an alarm clock and afternoons unhurried. She is known among her friends for hosting elaborate weekend brunches with dishes she spends hours perfecting, and she insists on fresh flowers in the kitchen even when the grocery budget is tight. Her extended family gatherings happen every Friday, a rhythm she sometimes finds suffocating but never skips.

## Entry 0 - 2025-08-31

The kids go back to school tomorrow and I should be relieved because summer has been exhausting, nonstop snacks and arguments and sunscreen reapplication, but instead I'm sitting on the balcony at midnight feeling like something got taken from me. Which is ridiculous because I was complaining about this exact summer two weeks ago.

It's the mornings I'll miss. Tariq leaves early anyway so it was just me and the kids, slow, no rushing. I'd make coffee the way I like it, with cardamom, and we'd eat fruit on the balcony before it got too hot. Nobody asking me to be anywhere. Nobody checking if I'd signed a permission slip. Just sun and sticky fingers and that particular quiet you get before the city wakes up fully.

Now it goes back to the schedule. Pack lunches at 6:30, iron uniforms, stand at the gate making small talk with other mothers who want to discuss tutoring. I know it sounds ungrateful. I know plenty of mothers would love to be home at all. But I keep thinking about those mornings and how I didn't appreciate them enough while they were happening.

**Nudge:** "What made those mornings feel different from the rest of summer?"

**Response:** No agenda. That's really it. Nobody needed anything from me yet.

## Entry 1 - 2025-09-02

First day back and it went fine, objectively. Hana was thrilled about her new teacher. Sami less so but he's nine, everything is beneath him now apparently. I got them there on time, uniforms pressed, lunches packed with the little notes they pretend to hate.

Came home to an empty house and immediately felt like I should be doing something productive. Laundry, organizing closets, something. Instead I sat on the couch and ate leftover knafeh for breakfast and watched a cooking show for two hours. Kept glancing at the door like someone was going to walk in and catch me. Catch me doing what? Sitting in my own house? I don't know why I can't just enjoy things without the running commentary in my head.

**Nudge:** "Whose voice is that commentary?"

**Response:** My mother's, probably. She never sat down during the day. Still doesn't.

Made the cardamom coffee again this morning after drop-off and drank it slowly on the balcony by myself. Twenty minutes of nothing. It felt like reclaiming something small.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-10

Tariq's mother called to say she thinks Sami should start Quran tutoring on Saturdays. Saturdays are the one day we have no obligations and now I'm supposed to give that up too. I didn't say no but I didn't say yes either and that silence is going to cost me later.

**Nudge:** "What does that silence usually lead to?"

**Response:** A longer phone call next week where she explains what a good mother would do.

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-13

Friday lunch at my parents' house again. Same food, same seating arrangement, same conversation about my brother's new car. Hana spilled grape juice on the couch and my mother gave me that look, the one that says I should have been watching more closely, even though there were fifteen adults in the room.

I don't hate Fridays. The food is good and the kids love seeing their cousins. But by the time we get home I feel like I've been performing for six hours straight. Smiling, helping in the kitchen, making sure the children behave, agreeing when my aunt says I'm lucky I don't have to work. Lucky. Sure. I came home and ran a bath so hot it turned my skin red and that was the best part of the entire day.

**Nudge:** "What would a Friday look like if you designed it?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-15

Something good happened and I want to write it down before I forget the feeling. Tariq came home early today, which never happens, and he said let's take the kids for ice cream. Not the place near the house, the one across town with the pistachio gelato and the little garden out back where they have jasmine growing along the wall.

We drove with the windows down and Hana sang the whole way, completely off key, and Sami was reading in the back seat which meant he was content. We sat outside and the light was doing that golden thing it does in September and I had two scoops and didn't think about anything else. Not the laundry, not Saturday tutoring, not what my mother-in-law thinks.

Tariq looked at me at one point and said "this is what matters, right?" and I almost cried because yes. This. Exactly this. A warm evening and good ice cream and my kids being happy and nobody asking me to be anything other than a person eating gelato in a garden. I want to hold onto this feeling but I already know tomorrow I'll wake up and the list will be there waiting.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-20

Spent money on a nice candle and a book I've been wanting and I don't need to justify it. Tariq didn't say anything about it. Nobody said anything about it. I'm the only one keeping score.

**Nudge:** "What would not keeping score look like?"

**Response:** I'll let you know when I figure that out. The candle smells incredible though.

## Entry 7 - 2025-09-24

The Saturday tutoring started. Tariq's mother won, of course. Sami was fine with it, which somehow makes it worse because I can't even claim I'm protecting him from something. He came home and recited what he'd learned and everyone on the family group chat sent clapping emojis and heart emojis and I felt like the walls were closing in.

It's not about the tutoring specifically. It's that every open space in the week gets filled. Every pocket of time that could be for something unstructured, something that just feels good, gets assigned a purpose by someone else. I keep losing these little windows and I don't know how to say that out loud without sounding like I don't care about my children's upbringing. I do care. I just also care about not disappearing entirely into the role.
