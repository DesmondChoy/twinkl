# Persona 002: Wei-Lin Chen

## Profile
- **Name:** Wei-Lin Chen
- **Age:** 45-54
- **Profession:** Grad Student
- **Culture:** East Asian
- **Core Values:** Power, Self-Direction
- **Bio:** Wei-Lin spent eighteen years climbing the corporate ladder at a Taipei tech firm before quitting at 47 to pursue a PhD in organizational psychology. She's two years into her program now, funding herself on savings while her former direct reports have taken over her old department. Her advisor tends to assign tasks without discussion, and departmental politics remind her uncomfortably of her old office—except now she's the one without a vote in meetings.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Spent most of the day in the library working on my literature review. The second-years have their qualifying exams coming up, so most of the good carrels were taken. Ended up at one of the open tables near the circulation desk.

Had office hours with Dr. Huang in the afternoon. She wants me to present at the departmental colloquium next month—apparently one of the fifth-years dropped out of the lineup. Not really a request. I said yes and added it to my calendar.

**Nudge:** "How'd you feel about being slotted in like that?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-06

Colloquium prep is taking longer than expected. Reworking the slides for a non-specialist audience. My cohort met for coffee but I couldn't stay long.

**Nudge:** "What's eating up the time?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-09

Colloquium went fine. People asked questions, I answered them. Dr. Huang nodded from the back row which I guess means it met whatever bar she had in mind. Afterward a few faculty came up to chat—the usual polite interest in my research, some suggestions for readings I've already done. One of them mentioned he'd supervised someone at my former company years ago. Small world comment, moved on.

The whole thing took maybe forty minutes but I've been tired since. Made instant noodles for dinner instead of cooking. Watched some YouTube videos about nothing in particular. Called my sister in Kaohsiung for a bit—she asked if I was sleeping enough, which means I probably look tired on camera too.

Now it's almost midnight and I should sleep but I'm just sitting here. The presentation is done, nothing urgent due this week. No real reason to still be awake except I don't feel like the day is finished somehow. Probably just post-event adrenaline wearing off.
