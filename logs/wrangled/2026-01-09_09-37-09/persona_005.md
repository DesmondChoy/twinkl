# Persona 005: Karen Mitchell

## Profile
- **Name:** Karen Mitchell
- **Age:** 45-54
- **Profession:** Nurse
- **Culture:** North American
- **Core Values:** Conformity
- **Bio:** Karen Mitchell has worked in the same hospital's cardiac care unit for twenty-two years, and the charge nurse still signs off on her schedules without question. Last month a resident dismissed her observation about a patient's irregular heart rhythm, and she nodded and charted it instead of pushing back. Her husband jokes that she schedules their family dinners like patient rounds. She spends her days off visiting her mother in the nursing home, organizing the church potluck, and reminding herself that keeping things running smoothly is what matters.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

Twelve-hour shift and I stayed an extra forty-five minutes because night shift was short again. That's not what's bothering me though. Mr. Patterson in room 312 kept insisting something was wrong, saying his chest felt different, not worse necessarily, just different. I mentioned it to Dr. Reeves during rounds and she waved it off, said his labs looked fine, EKG was stable. So I documented his complaint and moved on.

Around eight tonight his monitor alarmed and we called a rapid response. He's fine now, transferred to ICU for observation, but the whole time I kept thinking I should have said something more this morning. I could have pushed harder. I know when patients use words like "different" it usually means something. Twenty-two years, I know this. But she'd already moved on to the next room and I just let it go.

I keep telling myself that I did chart it, that I followed the process, that the outcome was okay. And technically I did everything right. But my feet hurt and my brain hurts and I can't shake the feeling that following the rules shouldn't mean staying quiet when you know better. Or maybe I don't actually know better and I'm just tired.

**Nudge:** "What would 'pushing harder' have looked like?"

**Response:** Honestly? I don't know. I think that's the problem. I've been doing this so long that I've gotten really good at documenting concerns and really bad at actually voicing them. Like somewhere along the way I decided the chart was the conversation. And maybe it's because every time I did speak up in my early years I got dismissed or told I was overstepping. Easier to just write it down and let someone else deal with it.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-04

Work was standard today. Census down to fourteen patients so we actually had time to take real lunch breaks. Helped Megan with an IV start on a patient with difficult veins, got it on the second try. She's still learning the angle for older patients whose veins roll.

After work I went to the grocery store for things for Sunday dinner. Mom wants pot roast this week so I got a three-pound chuck roast, potatoes, carrots, celery. The store was crowded because of the December rush but I found everything on the list. Tom was home when I got back and had already taken the garbage cans to the curb, which was nice because I forgot this morning.

Planning to meal prep tomorrow since I have the day off. Want to get ahead before the holiday rush at work. The schedule for Christmas week came out and I got the 24th and 26th, which is better than last year when I worked Christmas Day itself. Already told Mom we'll do our celebration on the 27th this year. She seemed fine with it. She's flexible about dates as long as we show up.

**Nudge:** "How'd she take the Christmas news originally?"

**Response:** She didn't really react much. You know how it is with holiday schedules in healthcare, everyone adjusts. She's been dealing with my shifts for over two decades now.

Strange day. Nothing happened exactly, just a lot of small moments that felt slightly off rhythm. Like the whole shift was a half-beat behind where it should be.

**Nudge:** "What kind of moments?"

**Response:** Little things. The med cart had a squeaky wheel nobody fixed. A family member asked me a question in the hall and I had to say I didn't know, which I hate. One of the aides called in sick so we were shuffling all day. Nothing dramatic, just enough friction to make the hours drag.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-15

Training day today. Annual competencies, mostly online modules I've done a dozen times before. Hand hygiene, infection control, workplace violence prevention. Took about four hours to get through everything with the required quizzes.

Sat with Deborah from the night shift during the in-person portion on the new IV pump system. We haven't talked much since she transferred from days last year. She mentioned she's thinking about going back to school for her BSN, asked if I had thoughts on the program at the community college. Told her I've heard good things but haven't looked into it myself. The afternoon went quickly.

**Nudge:** "Ever think about going back yourself?"

**Response:** Not really. I mean, I've thought about it in passing but never seriously. I have my ADN and it's gotten me this far. The hospital keeps talking about magnet status and BSN requirements, but they've been saying that for years. I figure if it becomes mandatory I'll deal with it then. No point borrowing trouble.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-22

Sunday dinner at Mom's went better than expected. She's been having more good days lately, remembering names and dates more clearly. We had the pot roast and she told the story about Dad burning the Christmas ham in 1987 for probably the hundredth time, but Tom laughed like he was hearing it fresh. I love that about him.

My sister called during dessert and we passed the phone around. She can't make it up from Texas this year because of her in-laws' schedule, but she sounded good. Not strained the way she gets sometimes. We talked about maybe doing a summer trip together, all of us, maybe rent a cabin somewhere. Nothing concrete but the idea felt nice.

The drive home was quiet in a good way. Tom handled the radio, I watched the streetlights go by. There's something settling about these dinners, even when the logistics are complicated. Twenty-seven years of marriage and we've figured out how to do family without it feeling like a performance. Everyone shows up, everyone does their part, nobody expects too much. It works because we let it work.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-28

The new resident on the unit is going to be a problem. Dr. Huang. She's probably brilliant, I'm sure she graduated top of her class, but she talks to nurses like we're her personal assistants rather than colleagues. Today she snapped at me in front of a patient's family because I asked her to clarify an order that didn't make sense.

I didn't say anything back. I just clarified the order, documented everything, and moved on. But I was fuming the rest of the shift. The family noticed the tension, I could see it in how they looked at me afterward. And now they probably think I did something wrong when really I was just trying to make sure their father didn't get the wrong dosage.

I should probably talk to my charge nurse about it but I don't want to be the one making waves. It's a teaching hospital, residents come and go, she'll learn eventually or she won't. Not my circus.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-01

New Year's Eve shift. Busy as expected. Three admissions, one code that we lost, one discharge that took forever because the family couldn't agree on the care plan. Home by nine this morning and slept until two but still feel wrung out.

The code is sitting with me. Mr. Franklin, seventy-four, came in with chest pain two days ago. His daughter had been difficult all week, questioning every decision, demanding second opinions, asking why we weren't doing more. During the code she stood in the doorway screaming at us to try harder. We tried for forty-five minutes. That's longer than protocol suggests but nobody wanted to call it while she was watching.

Afterward she thanked me. Grabbed my hand and thanked me for trying. And I nodded and said I was sorry, which is what you say. But what I wanted to say was that her father had a DNR discussion scheduled for this morning that never happened because he coded at four AM instead. That if she'd let the palliative care team talk to him last week like they wanted to, maybe his last hour wouldn't have been us breaking his ribs while she screamed.

I didn't say any of that. I held her hand and said I was sorry. That's the job. But sometimes the job asks you to be something you're not, and you do it anyway, and then you come home and wonder who you're actually being all day.

**Nudge:** "Who were you being in that moment?"

**Response:** I don't know. Someone who keeps things moving. Someone who doesn't make a hard situation harder. The version of me that does what's needed so everyone else can fall apart. But lately I've been wondering if that version is who I actually am or just who I've trained myself to be because it's easier. Like I've gotten so good at smoothing things over that I forgot I'm allowed to have edges.

Tom made me breakfast this morning without me asking. Pancakes, the ones with the crispy edges I like. Didn't say anything about it, just handed me the plate.

**Nudge:** "What did that feel like?"

**Response:** Like he saw me. Like he noticed I've been running on empty and decided to do something about it without making a big deal out of it. Sometimes that's all you need. Someone who just shows up.

## Entry 8 - 2026-01-09

Good day today, genuinely. Dr. Huang stopped me in the hall and apologized for how she spoke to me a couple weeks ago. Said she's been getting feedback from multiple nurses and realized she needed to adjust. I told her I appreciated it and that I know residency is hard. She actually smiled.

It's not a big thing but it felt like something shifted. Like maybe speaking up, even indirectly through whoever gave her that feedback, actually works sometimes. I didn't make waves myself but the waves got made anyway and the outcome was better for it. Maybe that's the lesson. Or maybe I'm just relieved I didn't have to be the one who said anything. Either way, the unit felt lighter this afternoon.
