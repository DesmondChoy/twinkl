# Persona 001: Gabriela Mendoza

## Profile
- **Name:** Gabriela Mendoza
- **Age:** 25-34
- **Profession:** Parent (Stay-at-home)
- **Culture:** Latin American
- **Core Values:** Power
- **Bio:** Gabriela Mendoza, 31, left her corporate HR position three years ago when her twin daughters were born, a decision she frames as taking charge of her family's direction rather than outsourcing it. She runs the household with meticulous precision from their home in a gated community outside Bogota, managing everything from the girls' enrichment schedules to the family budget while her husband travels for work. She volunteers on the parents' committee at the private preschool not just to help but because she wanted a seat at the table where decisions get made. Lately she's been feeling the sting of well-meaning relatives who treat her like she's "just home with the kids," not recognizing the weight of everything she holds together.

## Entry 0 - 2025-12-01

People keep asking when I'm going back to work like staying home isn't work. Like I'm on some extended vacation while my husband "provides." I had to remind my mother-in-law at Sunday lunch that I manage a household budget larger than most departments I used to oversee. The look on her face. She didn't say anything after that.

Actually felt good to say it out loud. I'm not defensive about my choices. I chose this. I chose to be the one who knows exactly what my daughters need, who makes sure this household runs, who doesn't hand off the hard parts to someone else. That's not less than a job title. That's everything.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-09

Parents' committee meeting today. The new curriculum proposal passed. I had to push back on some of the scheduling conflicts but got it through. Picked up the girls, made dinner, reviewed next week's activities.

Camilo called from Lima. He'll be back Thursday. The girls barely asked about him this time. They're used to it now, I suppose. We all are.

**Nudge:** "What does that feel like when they don't ask?"

**Response:** It's fine. Honestly, it's easier. When he's here, there's this disruption to our rhythm. The girls get overstimulated, bedtime gets pushed, then I'm the one dealing with cranky kids the next morning while he's already on another call. When he's away, we have our system. It works. They have me, and I have control over how things go.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-11

Spent the afternoon at my sister Lucia's place. Her kids are a year older than mine and she homeschools them, does everything differently. Less structured, more chaotic. She lets them eat when they're hungry instead of at set times, lets them quit activities if they're not into it. Her house is messy. Her kids seem happy.

I kept noticing myself cataloging the differences. The way she shrugged when her son said he didn't want to practice piano anymore. "He'll find something else," she said. I couldn't do that. I think about what my girls will have to compete with later, the skills they'll need, the advantages I can build for them now. Lucia doesn't think that way. She trusts it'll work out.

Maybe she can afford to think like that because her husband is around more. Or maybe she's just wired differently. I don't know. I kept reorganizing her kitchen in my head while we talked, thinking about how I'd optimize the space. She'd hate that if she knew. I just can't turn it off.

**Nudge:** "What would turning it off even look like?"

**Response:** I don't know. Maybe not scanning every room for what needs fixing. Not looking at my daughters and immediately thinking about what they're missing, what gap I need to fill. Just... sitting with them? The way Lucia sits with her kids, present but not planning three steps ahead. Sometimes I watch her and wonder if she's actually relaxed or if I just can't read her stress. It scares me a little, that I can't tell the difference anymore.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-20

Camilo's parents are hosting Christmas this year and his mother already sent the menu and the seating chart. The seating chart. For her own family dinner. I should find this funny. She's just like me, people say. I don't know why that makes me want to throw something.

She put me next to Camilo's brother's new girlfriend, the one who runs marathons and works at a startup. Fresh audience for the "so what do you do" question. I already know how it goes. I say I'm home with the twins and watch her face try to arrange itself into something supportive. Sort of want to skip the whole thing but that's not an option so I'll just smile and make sure my daughters are the best-behaved kids in the room. At least that's something no one can take from me.

**Nudge:** "What's the 'sort of' about?"

**Response:** It's just holiday stress. Everyone deals with in-laws. I'm fine. Already picked out the girls' outfits anyway.

## Entry 4 - 2026-01-05

Back from Christmas. Glad that's over. The girls were angels, everyone said so. Valentina even recited the little poem we practiced, in front of everyone. My mother-in-law actually looked impressed. That felt good.

School starts again Monday. Already have the first month mapped out - swimming on Tuesdays, art on Thursdays, the new reading program their teacher recommended. Camilo says I'm overcomplicating things but he doesn't see how quickly they fall behind if you don't stay on top of it. He gets to float in and out. I'm the one who has to make sure they're ready.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-05

The girls made me breakfast today. Well, they poured cereal and carried it very carefully to my bed. Milk everywhere. Sofia was so proud, insisted I eat it right there, soggy flakes and all. I did.

Didn't check my phone for like two hours after that. We just stayed in bed, them crawling all over me, showing me their stuffed animals' "families." Valentina has this whole hierarchy for her toys, who's the mom, who's the boss, who has to listen. I wonder where she gets that. Probably me. It was nice though. Being the one they wanted to bring breakfast to. Not because I organized it, just because.

**Nudge:** "What was different about those two hours?"

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-13

Parents' committee elections are next month. Marina Echeverri is running for president and everyone assumes she'll get it because her husband donated the new playground. Nobody says it out loud but that's what it is. Money talks.

I've done more actual work than anyone else on that committee. I'm the one who fixed the scheduling system, who actually reads the policy documents, who shows up prepared. But I didn't write a check for playground equipment so apparently that matters less. Considering whether to run anyway or if that would just be embarrassing. Camilo says I'm making it bigger than it is but he doesn't understand. It's not about the title. It's about being recognized for what I actually do.
