Took my mother to her physiotherapy session this morning. The appointment ran long so I joined the 10 AM standup from the hospital parking lot. Normal Monday.

**Nudge:** "How'd the parking lot standup go?"

**Response:** Fine, nobody noticed. Had to mute when the doctor came out to discuss her exercises.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-05

Quarterly reviews are done. Spent most of the week writing performance summaries for each team member, which takes longer than HR probably realizes. I try to remember specific moments from the past three months for each person rather than just listing metrics. Ahmad from the warehouse team teared up a little when I mentioned how he stepped up during the September container backlog. That felt worth the extra hours.

My mother had a better week. She managed to walk to the kitchen twice without the walker, which made her so proud she called her sister in Amman to tell her. Small victories. Layla made her favorite dish to celebrate, mansaf with the lamb just the way she likes it.

Friday I promised Yusuf I would look at his car, the one he bought cheap from a classmate. The engine makes a clicking sound. I used to love this kind of thing. Now it is just another item on the list.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-11

My brother Faisal called again about money. Third time this month. He wants help covering his daughter's private school fees because he says the public options near him are not good enough. I said I would think about it and he got quiet in that way he does.

I already send money to help with his rent. Layla does not say anything but I see her face when these calls come. My mother asked why I looked upset after and I told her it was work. Did not want to put her in the middle of her sons.

**Nudge:** "What's the 'think about it' really mean?"

**Response:** It means no but I cannot say that to him. He is my brother. But Nadia starts her master's program next year and we have not saved enough. I keep doing the math in my head and it does not add up.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-20

Three of my team members came to me separately this week with personal problems. Divorce, a sick parent, financial stress. I listened to all of them, helped where I could, covered shifts, made calls. That is what you do. But when I sat in my car after work yesterday I just stared at the steering wheel for twenty minutes. Could not make myself drive home yet.

I am tired in a way that sleep does not fix. My mother needed help with her medications last night at 2 AM and I was already awake, just lying there. Layla was asleep. I did not wake her because she has her own exhaustion. So I got up and sat with my mother until she fell back asleep, then watched the sky get light.

**Nudge:** "The twenty minutes in the car - what were you waiting for?"

**Response:** Nothing specific. Just needed a minute before walking through the door with the right face on.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-28

People keep asking if I am okay, like my face is giving something away. I am fine. Had a good Eid with the family, the house was full, my mother was happy seeing everyone. Cooked for fourteen people and yes it was a lot of work but that is what these days are for.

My cousin Hanan pulled me aside and said I look thinner. I told her I have been walking more, which is true. She gave me that look women give when they do not believe you but will not push. Anyway the food was good, the kids played cards with their grandmother, and Faisal actually showed up on time for once. That counts as a win.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-02

New year. I do not usually do resolutions but I woke up early today and sat with my coffee before anyone else was up. The house was quiet in that way it rarely is anymore. I thought about what I actually want this year, not what I need to do for everyone else but what I want for myself. Took me a while to come up with anything.

I want to finish one book. Just one. I used to read constantly but the last novel I finished was maybe three years ago. I want to take Layla somewhere, even just overnight, without coordinating schedules around my mother's appointments first. I want to hear my children laugh at something I said, the real laugh not the polite one.

Small things. But sitting there in the quiet, they felt like enough. My mother woke up around seven and I made her tea. She held my hand for a moment and said I was a good son. I do not know why that made my throat tight but it did.

## Entry 6 - 2026-01-11

Good day at work. Finally approved the training budget I have been fighting for since October. Three of my team members can now take the supply chain certification course they wanted. Mariam in particular has been asking about this for over a year. She sent me a message after the announcement that just said thank you with about fifteen exclamation points.

Came home to find Yusuf had fixed his car himself using a YouTube video. The clicking is gone. He was so proud showing me what he did, explaining the timing belt issue. I pretended I did not already know what the problem was, let him have the full victory. That felt right.

My mother had a small setback, some swelling in her ankle, but the doctor says it is normal and rest will help. She was frustrated about being told to stay off her feet again. I sat with her and we watched her favorite Egyptian drama, the one with the family feuds that she follows like it is real news. She fell asleep on the couch and I covered her with a blanket before going to bed.

## Entry 7 - 2026-01-20

Long week, just now sitting down. Nadia came home for the weekend and the house feels different when she is here, more alive somehow. She brought laundry which I pretended to complain about but honestly it is nice to have something of hers to fold again.

Had lunch with the team yesterday, someone's birthday, the usual cake in the break room. Fadi made a joke about me being the office dad and everyone laughed. I laughed too. Drove home thinking about that, office dad, home dad, brother keeper, son. Lot of titles. Played some Fairuz on the drive which helped.

**Nudge:** "The titles - which one fits best right now?"

**Response:** Honestly the Fairuz helped more than thinking about it. But if I had to pick, I would say son. My mother will not be here forever and I want to make sure she knows she is taken care of until the end.

## Entry 8 - 2026-01-30

Had a performance review today. My manager said all good things, exceeds expectations on most categories, but then asked if I had considered that I take on too much. She used the word boundaries which I find irritating. I do what needs to be done. If someone needs help I am not going to pretend I do not notice.

She mentioned that I often stay late, that I respond to emails at midnight, that I volunteered for three extra projects this quarter. I told her I manage my time fine. She nodded in that way managers nod when they are writing a mental note for your file. Whatever.

Came home and Layla had made dinner already even though it was my night. She said I sounded tired on the phone. I was not tired, or maybe I was, but it is not the kind of tired that changes anything. We ate together, talked about Yusuf's internship applications, watched the news. She leaned against my shoulder on the couch. That was enough. I do not need someone at work telling me how to structure my life when my life, messy as it is, has people in it who lean against my shoulder at the end of the day.
