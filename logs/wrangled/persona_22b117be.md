- **Name:** Harold Delacroix
- **Age:** 55+
- **Profession:** Grad Student

He relocated from suburban Detroit to Boston for the program. Having spent thirty years climbing a corporate ladder that suddenly disappeared beneath him, Harold struggles with being the oldest person in his cohort and having to defer to professors half his age.

## Entry 0 - 2025-04-28

Orientation session today. Sat in the back row out of habit, then realized I was the only one over forty in the entire lecture hall. The program coordinator kept talking about "building your professional foundation" and I wanted to raise my hand and say that some of us already had a foundation, thank you, before it was demolished without warning.

I kept my mouth shut. That is what you do. You do not embarrass yourself by complaining about circumstances nobody asked about. But walking back to my apartment afterward, I felt it — that heaviness in my chest. I am not sure if this was the right decision. Forty thousand dollars a year to be lectured about organizational behavior by someone who has never actually run an organization.

**Nudge:** "What would make this decision feel worth it by the time you graduate?"

**Response:** A title that commands respect again. A role where people come to me for guidance, not the other way around. I suppose I want to walk into a room and have people assume I belong there, the way they used to.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-30

Group project assigned today. I was placed with three twenty-somethings who immediately started a WhatsApp thread I had to ask them to explain how to join. They scheduled our first meeting for 10 PM on a weeknight.

## Entry 2 - 2025-04-30

Could not sleep after writing that last note. The 10 PM meeting is bothering me more than it should. Back when I managed the retail lending division, if someone scheduled a meeting for 10 PM, there had better have been an emergency — a systems failure, a regulatory audit, something serious. These kids treat it like nothing.

I know I am supposed to adapt. That is the whole point of coming back to school — proving I can learn new ways of working. But there is a difference between adapting and abandoning every standard you spent a career developing. I ran teams. I built processes. I had an executive assistant who managed my calendar. Now I am asking a twenty-three-year-old named "Brayden" how to download an app on my phone.

The worst part is that I smiled and thanked him. What else was I supposed to do? Throw a tantrum about how things used to be? I have seen those people. They become cautionary tales whispered about in break rooms. So I will show up to the 10 PM meeting and I will contribute my ideas and I will be pleasant about all of it. That is the only path forward.

But I am writing this at 11:47 PM because I cannot stop replaying the moment when Brayden said "it's super easy, here let me show you" with that patient voice you use for elderly relatives who cannot work the remote control.

**Nudge:** "You mentioned you smiled and thanked him. What would have happened if you'd responded differently — said something honest about how that moment felt?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-01

Professor Chen called on me in class today and I gave a detailed answer drawing on my experience restructuring our branch network in 2019. She nodded politely and said "that's one perspective, but let's look at what the research shows." Then proceeded to present a case study that contradicted half of what I said.

I stayed after class to discuss it further and she said my "practitioner insights are valuable" but that academic rigor requires us to "question our assumptions." I am not sure what assumptions she thinks I have. I was there. I saw what worked. The branch network I restructured is still operational — or it was until the whole bank got acquired.

My daughter texted me later asking how school was going. I told her it was fine.

**Nudge:** "When you told your daughter things were fine, was that to protect her from worrying, or something else?"

**Response:** She has her own problems to deal with. My job is to handle mine.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-03

The 10 PM meeting went until midnight. Brayden talked for forty-five minutes about "leveraging synergies" without saying anything concrete. I drafted the entire project outline afterward because someone had to. Submitted it to the group chat at 2 AM.

---

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-08

Interesting development. The group used my outline almost word for word. Brayden presented it in class as "our collaborative framework" and the professor praised the "clear structure and practical grounding." Nobody mentioned that I wrote it. I did not correct them.

Here is the thing though. I felt something shift when I saw the professor nodding along. That familiar feeling from the old days — when you put something together that works and people respond to it. The recognition does not need to be public. I know what I contributed. The professor knows the quality improved dramatically between our brainstorm and our deliverable.

Maybe this is how it works now. You do the work, you let other people take the stage, you build influence through competence rather than title. I am not sure I like it. But I am starting to see that there might be a way to operate here that is not completely foreign to who I am.

My ex-wife used to say I cared too much about getting credit. She meant it as criticism. Maybe she had a point, or maybe she did not understand what it is like to have your competence be the only thing you can rely on. Either way, the work got done. That matters.

**Nudge:** "What made you decide not to correct them about the outline? Was it strategic, or did something else hold you back?"

**Response:** I suppose I was testing something. Whether I could let go of the credit and still feel like myself. And I did, mostly. But there was also this — if I had spoken up, I would have been the old man demanding acknowledgment. I have seen how quickly people dismiss that. Better to let the work speak and see who notices.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-14

Career services appointment today. The counselor — probably thirty years old at most — asked me what kind of "pivot" I was hoping to make. I explained that I am not pivoting, I am rebuilding. She looked confused.

I walked her through my background and she said the market is "challenging" for candidates my age but that I have "transferable skills." Transferable. As if thirty years of leadership is a foreign currency that needs to be exchanged for something more useful. I thanked her for her time and left with a folder of job search resources I will probably never open.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-15

Midterm grades posted. I received the highest score in the section on my case analysis. Professor Chen left a comment: "Exceptional integration of theory and practice." I printed it out and put it in my desk drawer.

**Nudge:** "Why did you print it? What will having that piece of paper there do for you?"

**Response:** Evidence. Proof that I was not imagining things — that I do know what I am doing, even in this environment. On the days when I feel like an artifact, I can open that drawer and see that someone with credentials agrees I have something to offer.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-19

Group presentation today. I suggested we rehearse beforehand but was outvoted. "We'll figure it out live," Brayden said. So we went in unrehearsed and it showed — stumbling over transitions, contradicting each other on key points. Professor Chen gave us a B-minus and commented that our "individual insights were strong but integration was lacking."

I wanted to say something afterward but held back. What would be the point? They would just see me as the cranky old guy who cannot roll with informality. Better to take the grade and move on. But it grates. I built my reputation on preparation. On never walking into a room without knowing exactly what I was going to say and why. Watching twenty years of professional instincts get overridden by committee feels like swallowing glass.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-25

Sunday afternoon. First time in weeks I do not have something due tomorrow. Went to a coffee shop near campus and just sat for a while. Watched the students come and go with their laptops and their confidence and their entire futures stretching out in front of them.

I remember that feeling. Not the specifics — I was not a coffee shop person at twenty-five — but the sense that time was on my side. That I could make mistakes and recover. That every door led to another door. Now I feel like I am running out of doors. Or maybe I already picked one and the rest all closed behind me.

Here is what I have been circling around for weeks: I came back to school because I could not stand being unemployed. Being introduced at parties as "Harold, he's figuring out his next chapter." The pity. The sudden availability of career advice from people who had never managed anyone. An MBA gave me something to say when people asked what I was doing. A credential that signals I am still in the game.

But sitting here today, I wonder if that is enough of a reason. If I am just collecting another piece of paper to avoid facing the question of what I actually want from whatever time is left.

## Entry 10 - 2025-05-30

Email from a former colleague today. She is now VP at a regional credit union and asked if I would be interested in consulting on a branch optimization project over the summer. The pay is modest but the work is exactly what I know how to do.

I said yes immediately, then spent an hour wondering if I should have negotiated. Old habits. But the truth is I would have done it for free just to be back in a room where people want my opinion, not because of an assignment but because I have answers they need. That probably sounds desperate. Maybe it is.

**Nudge:** "You said you would have done it for free. What does that tell you about what you're really looking for right now?"

**Response:** That I need to matter somewhere. The MBA is about credentials, about what looks right on paper. But this — someone calling because they remembered I knew what I was doing — that is about actually being useful. I suppose I have been confusing the two.

## Entry 11 - 2025-05-30

End of semester. Submitted my last paper at 11:58 PM. Overall GPA: 3.7. I should feel accomplished. Mostly I feel relieved that I can stop pretending to be something I am not for three months. The consulting project starts Monday.
