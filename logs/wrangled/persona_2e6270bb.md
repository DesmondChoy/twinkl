People act like delivery drivers don't know anything. I managed forty people at that factory. I know how to read a room, how to negotiate, how to plan logistics. Just because I'm on a scooter now doesn't mean I forgot everything.

**Nudge:** "When did someone last treat you like you didn't know anything?"

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-13

Decent week overall. Made about NT$18,000, which is slightly above average. The weather has been cooperating - no heavy rain, which means more orders and fewer accidents. I've been mapping out which restaurants have the fastest pickup times during dinner rush. Found that the smaller family-run places actually have better turnaround than the chain restaurants because they're not juggling ten delivery apps at once.

My wife mentioned that her store might cut hours in January. She said it casually, like it was nothing, but I saw her checking our savings account balance on her phone afterward. We have enough for three months, maybe four if we're careful. I've been taking the late-night shifts that nobody wants - the ones that end at 2 AM. The surge pricing is better then, and there's less competition from the younger drivers.

The app keeps pushing this "Diamond Driver" program where you get priority orders if you maintain high ratings. I'm at 4.92 right now. Would need to stay above 4.9 for two months straight. It's sort of worth it, I guess. Priority access means more consistent income.

**Nudge:** "What's the part that makes it only 'sort of' worth it?"

**Response:** Just takes a lot of energy to keep the smile on, you know? Anyway, it's fine.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-13

My brother called tonight. He lives in Kaohsiung, works at a bank. He asked how the "side job" was going. I told him it's not a side job, it's my job. He made that sound, that little "ah" that means he doesn't believe me but won't argue.

He always does this. Acts concerned but really he just wants to feel better about his own choices. He stayed at the same bank for twenty years, never took a single risk. And now he acts like I failed at something when really the factory failed. It wasn't my decision to close it. I didn't make the products nobody wanted to buy anymore.

My son was home for the weekend and heard part of the call. He didn't say anything but I could tell he was uncomfortable. Later I heard him tell my wife that maybe I should "explore other options." What options? I'm 48. The HR screening software throws out resumes from anyone over 40 before a human even sees them. I know this because I used to be on the other side of that process.

I'm not going to apologize for doing what needs to be done to keep this family running. The gig economy isn't some failure - it's adaptation. That's what I taught my team back at the factory: adapt or get left behind. I'm adapting.

**Nudge:** "What did it feel like hearing your son say that?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-16

Can't stop thinking about my old office. The chair, the window that looked out at the parking lot, the way people would knock before coming in. Nobody knocks for delivery drivers. They just grab the food and close the door.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-16

Customer gave me one star because the restaurant forgot her drink. I explained it wasn't my fault. She said "whatever" and shut the door. My rating dropped to 4.88. Three weeks of perfect service, gone because of someone else's mistake.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-20

Long day. Started at 11 AM, just got home at midnight. Made NT$2,800 which is okay. My back hurts from the scooter. The seat needs replacing but that's another NT$1,500 I don't want to spend right now.

Ran into Mr. Huang at a pickup. He used to work in purchasing at the factory - we'd have lunch together sometimes. He pretended not to recognize me. Put on his sunglasses even though we were inside, grabbed his order, walked away fast. I wanted to say something but what would I say? "Remember when we both had offices?" It's fine. People handle things differently. At least I'm not the one hiding.

**Nudge:** "Do you actually think he was hiding from you specifically?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-25

Christmas. Working today because the surge pricing is excellent and most drivers take the day off to be with family. My wife wasn't happy but she understood. My son went back to Taichung for a friend's party. So it would have just been the two of us anyway.

I keep thinking about hierarchy. At the factory, I knew exactly where I stood - three levels below the director, two above the line supervisors. Clear chain of command. Now there's just the app. The app doesn't care that I have fifteen years of management experience. The app sees: delivery completed, time elapsed, customer rating. Three numbers. That's all I am now.

Some of the younger drivers formed a LINE group, share tips about which areas have better orders. They invited me but I don't participate much. They talk about this work like it's freedom - no boss, make your own hours. Maybe when you're 25 with no mortgage it feels that way. For me it feels like standing on ice that might crack any second.

My wife texted to ask when I'm coming home. She attached a photo of the dinner she made - nothing fancy, just three dishes and rice. The table looked empty with only one place setting out. I told her I'd be back by 10. It's 8:30 now and I'm sitting in my scooter outside a hot pot restaurant waiting for an order, writing this instead of going inside where it's warm.

**Nudge:** "Why didn't you go inside where it's warm?"

**Response:** Because inside I'm just a delivery guy waiting for order 847. Outside I'm just a man on a scooter. At least out here nobody's looking at me deciding what I am.

Got home at 10:30. Wife had already put everything in the fridge. She didn't say anything, just handed me a plate and went to bed. The food was cold but I ate it anyway. I'm not sure what I'm actually saving all this money for.

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-28

Year-end is always busy. Everyone ordering food instead of cooking. I should be grateful for the work. I keep telling myself that.

Today a customer - young guy, maybe late twenties, nice apartment in Da'an district - tipped me NT$100. Then he said, "Uncle, you should take care of yourself. This weather is harsh." He meant well. I know he meant well. But something about being called "Uncle" by someone half my age, living in an apartment that costs more monthly than I made in three months at the factory, offering me NT$100 like it would make a difference... I said thank you. What else could I say?

I remember when I was his age. I had just been promoted to assistant manager. I thought I would keep climbing. Director by 45, maybe VP by 50 if I played my cards right. I had a plan. The plan had steps. Now the only steps I think about are the ones between the elevator and the apartment door, hoping there's not too many flights to climb with hot soup that's getting cold.

My son called to say he got a part-time job at his university. Research assistant for one of his professors. He sounded proud. I told him that's great, focus on your studies, don't worry about money. But of course he should worry about money. Everyone should. He's watching what happened to me and thinking: I won't let that happen. And I don't know if that makes me proud or ashamed. Probably both.

**Nudge:** "What would make you lean more toward proud than ashamed?"

## Entry 9 - 2026-01-04

New year, new goals. Hit Diamond Driver status finally - 4.91 rating maintained for two months. Priority orders start Monday. Wife's hours weren't cut after all.

**Nudge:** "How did it feel when you hit Diamond?"

**Response:** Good, I guess. It's just a status. Means more consistent orders.
