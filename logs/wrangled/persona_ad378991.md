Board meeting for the trade association today. One of the newer members, a woman from a Cambodian labour rights group, raised concerns about working conditions at several member factories — specifically about informal workers who sort e-waste without proper protective gear. She had photos. She had data from a university study. She asked the board to issue a formal statement and require audits before renewing factory memberships.

I didn't say anything. I just sat there. A few other board members started pushing back immediately — talking about how the data was old, how conditions had improved, how public statements would hurt investment confidence in the sector. The usual deflections. And I know they're partly right, some of those factories have made genuine improvements. But the photos were recent. The data wasn't old. I could see the timestamps.

The thing is, two of those factories are long-standing clients of mine. We process their scrap. If I backed the statement, it would put those relationships at risk. Not just financially — personally. I've known these owners for over a decade. We've eaten at each other's homes. It's not as simple as just raising your hand and saying yes, we should hold them accountable. There are layers to this. But I keep replaying her face when nobody supported her motion. She looked like she expected it. That's worse somehow — that she wasn't even surprised.

**Nudge:** "What stopped you from backing her?"

**Response:** The relationships. Twenty years of built trust. You don't blow that up in a board meeting.

My son called from Jakarta. His NGO just secured funding to expand their mangrove restoration project into two new provinces. I could hear it in his voice — the energy, the belief that what he's doing actually matters. I told him I was proud. I meant it completely.

After we hung up I transferred some money to the foundation account. Not a huge amount, but enough to cover the clean-water pump installation we've been delaying in Siem Reap because the supplier raised prices. My wife asked why I didn't just wait until next quarter when cash flow is better. I told her some things shouldn't wait. She gave me that look she gives when she thinks I'm being impulsive, but she processed the transfer anyway.

**Nudge:** "What was it about that call that made you act right away?"

**Response:** Hearing him talk about the mangroves reminded me why I started the foundation. Sometimes you forget.

Flew back from a factory visit in Penang. The new processing line looks good, efficiency is way up, costs are down. Everyone was pleased. On the drive to the airport the plant manager mentioned casually that they'd switched to a cheaper chemical solvent for circuit board stripping. Cheaper and, I suspect, not properly rated for ventilation in that building. I could smell it from the parking lot.

I didn't ask about it. I could have. I had forty minutes in the car and I know enough about chemical handling to ask the right questions. But I was tired and the deal was done and bringing it up would have meant delaying the whole partnership review. I chose convenience. The flight home felt longer than usual.

People keep asking why I don't just retire and run the foundation full-time. As if it's that simple. The business funds everything — the foundation, my children's projects, the scholarships. Without it there's nothing to give.

**Nudge:** "What would you lose if you let it go?"

**Response:** Not just income. The ability to actually do something about the problems I see. Money is leverage.

Saturday morning, went to the hawker centre near our old Toa Payoh flat. The uncle who runs the wonton noodle stall has been there since my kids were small, must be almost thirty years now. We talked for a while. He's worried about his lease renewal, says the rents keep going up and the younger hawkers can't make it work anymore. Whole stretch of stalls might close.

I started thinking about whether the trade association could do something — not directly but maybe model something. We talk a lot about industry sustainability but it's always about supply chains and compliance frameworks. Nobody talks about what happens to the communities around these supply chains. The hawker uncle isn't e-waste, obviously, but it's the same pattern. Small people squeezed by systems that don't see them. I should bring this up at the next meeting. Or maybe I'll just sit there again. Don't know.

**Nudge:** "What would it take for you to actually bring it up?"

**Response:** Probably nothing. The agenda is always packed and nobody wants to hear philosophy from the recycling guy.

Dinner with old university friends tonight. David made a comment about how the migrant worker housing situation in Singapore has been "overblown by the media." Two others at the table agreed. I remember David saying something similar during the dormitory outbreaks a few years ago.

I didn't push back. I changed the subject to the new hawker centre opening in Bukit Merah. The conversation moved on. My wife squeezed my hand under the table — she knows what I think about the worker housing issue. We've donated to a couple of migrant worker charities quietly. But sitting there listening to David dismiss it, and just letting it pass — that sat with me on the drive home.

Chose a cheaper shipping route for the Cambodia pump equipment today. Faster and half the cost, but it goes through a freight company I know cuts corners on packaging for rural deliveries. Easier for me. Maybe not for whoever unpacks a damaged pump at the other end.

**Nudge:** "Worth the savings?"
