# Persona 5c8ad0db: Rohan Mehta

## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 5c8ad0db
- **Name:** Rohan Mehta
- **Age:** 30
- **Profession:** Entrepreneur
- **Culture:** South Asian
- **Core Values:** Power
- **Bio:** Rohan runs a SaaS logistics startup in Bangalore that he co-founded three years ago after leaving a product lead role at a well-known e-commerce firm. He negotiated himself the CEO title even though there are only nineteen employees, and he keeps a framed photo of his first office lease signing on his desk. His parents still introduce him at family gatherings as "the one who left the safe job to build his own company," which he finds both irritating and privately satisfying. He tracks which founders in his YC batch have raised more than him and adjusts his LinkedIn headline whenever someone in his network gets featured in a trade publication.

Long day. Back-to-back calls with the ops team, then a vendor demo that went nowhere. Ordered biryani from that place near Koramangala and ate it standing at my desk between Slack messages.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-19

Good morning for once. Walked into the all-hands and the team actually went quiet when I started talking. Not in a forced way — more like they were waiting for what I'd say because it mattered. I laid out the Q3 roadmap, handled the questions without anyone second-guessing the direction, and wrapped it in thirty minutes flat. Even Priya, who always has a follow-up objection, just nodded.

After the meeting, Arjun from engineering came up and said he liked the framing on the enterprise pivot. Didn't ask for it, didn't fish for it. He just said it. Small thing, but I've been pushing this pivot for two months against a lot of internal skepticism, and hearing someone voluntarily say it made sense — that hit differently.

I know some people think I care too much about being the one steering the ship, and maybe I do. But days like today remind me why I left a comfortable desk to do this. I didn't want to execute someone else's vision forever. I wanted the room to look at me and know that I'm the one making the call. Today they did, and it felt right.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-19

Spoke too soon this morning. Investor call this evening, and Vikram — my own co-founder — cut me off mid-pitch to "clarify" my revenue projections. The investor looked at him, not me, for the rest of the call. I didn't say anything.

**Nudge:** "You let that slide — what held you back?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-26

Spent half the week waiting on this one decision. We need approval from the enterprise client's procurement team to move forward with the pilot, and they keep saying "by end of week" and then nothing. I've sent three follow-up emails, each one a little more carefully worded than the last because you can't sound desperate, you can't sound pushy, you just have to sound like you're casually checking in even though the entire Q3 plan hinges on this one green light from someone I've never met.

My Amma called yesterday and asked how business is going. I told her great, growing fast. Didn't mention that I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox like an intern waiting for a response from a mid-level procurement officer named Suresh who probably doesn't even know what our product does. I'm the CEO of this company and I can't move my own roadmap forward because some guy in a cubicle in Pune hasn't gotten around to clicking approve.

The worst part is Vikram doesn't seem bothered. He said "these things take time" like that's an acceptable answer. Maybe for him it is. He's the CTO, he can go write code while we wait. I'm the one who has to explain to the board why the pilot hasn't started yet. I'm the one who looks like he can't close.

**Nudge:** "What's worse — the waiting or who you become while you wait?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-01

Had a strategy disagreement with Vikram again, this time about pricing. I wanted to go aggressive — undercut the market, lock in the enterprise accounts, worry about margins later once we have the install base. He wanted a premium positioning play, said undercutting makes us look desperate. We went back and forth for an hour in the conference room and I could tell the team outside could hear us through the glass.

The thing is, I still think I'm right. I've done the competitor analysis, I know what Freshworks did in their early days, I know how this market works. But Vikram had the numbers laid out differently and the team started leaning his way. Nisha from sales said "I think the premium angle is easier to pitch," and once she said that, it was over. I agreed to his approach because fighting it further would have made me look like I was digging in out of ego rather than strategy.

But sitting here now, what sticks with me isn't even the pricing decision. It's the moment I saw the room shift. It's the feeling of having built this company, having recruited every person in that room, and watching them choose someone else's direction over mine. My father ran his garment business for twenty-five years and nobody in his shop would have contradicted him publicly like that. Different era, I know. But I keep thinking about it.

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-07

Went to a founder networking event in Indiranagar last night. This guy from some Web3 startup — couldn't have been older than twenty-four — asked me "so what stage are you at?" and when I said Series A, he actually said "oh, still early then" and turned to talk to someone else. Like I was a booth he'd already walked past. I've been running this company for three years, managed a team twice his size before he probably finished college, and I'm "still early."

I know it shouldn't bother me. I know the kid was probably just performing for the room. But I drove home and sat in my car for a while before going up to the flat. Meera asked why I was late and I said traffic. I didn't want to explain that a stranger made me feel like I haven't done enough. Because I have. I just can't figure out why it still gets to me.

**Nudge:** "What would 'enough' actually look like for you?"
