## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My sister asked why I'm still doing this instead of "getting a real job." I don't need to explain myself to someone who's never had to rebuild from zero.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry ends with dismissive defensiveness but underlying hurt is visible in the "rebuild from zero" phrase - suggests more beneath the surface.
"What's the part she doesn't get?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

She doesn't get that a "real job" means trusting someone else not to pull the rug out. I had that. I showed up every day for twelve years. And then one meeting in a conference room I'd never been in, and it was done. At least now I know exactly what I'm working with.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-04

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Fourteen hours today because the app kept showing surge pricing downtown. Legs hurt. Need to replace the cabin air filter but it can wait until next week.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions the surge pricing drove the decision to work 14 hours - there's a dangling thread about what makes him push that hard.
"Worth it?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

The math works out. Made almost two hundred extra. But I sat in the parking lot at the end trying to remember if I'd eaten anything besides a protein bar. So, I don't know. Yes? The number in my account says yes.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got an email from a logistics company I applied to months ago. They want to schedule a phone screen. Benefits, salary, the whole thing. I should be excited. I sat there staring at the email for twenty minutes.

The job is in Phoenix. I'd have to move. Leave the apartment I've had for seven years, the mechanic who actually fixes things right, the routes I know by heart. Start over somewhere where I don't know anyone, don't know which neighborhoods tip well, don't know anything. And what if it doesn't work out? What if I'm six months in and they downsize or the manager decides he doesn't like me?

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Clear internal conflict between wanting stability (benefits, salary) and fear of instability (moving, unknown). The "I should be excited" signals the tension.
"What's making you hesitate most?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

I don't know. All of it, I guess. Need to think about it more.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Turned down the Phoenix interview. People keep telling me I'm making a mistake. Maybe I am. But I've made bigger ones by trusting that things would just work out.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: The "maybe I am" acknowledges doubt but then quickly justifies with past experience. There's unresolved conflict about whether this was the right call.
"Does it feel like the right call?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Honestly? Some days. Other days I look at my spreadsheet and think about what health insurance would mean if something went wrong. But I can't shake the feeling that I'd be trading one kind of worry for another. At least here, when things go sideways, I see it coming.

## Entry 5 - 2026-01-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

New Year's was quiet. Worked until 2 AM because everyone else was out celebrating. Emergency fund hit seven months today.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Session cap not reached (only 2 nudges in last 3 entries). Entry mentions reaching 7 months emergency fund milestone but doesn't explore what that means - classic dangling thread.
"Seven months. How's that feel?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Better than six. Still not where I want to be. I keep moving the goal post, I know. But every time I think about relaxing a little, I remember how fast things fell apart last time. The number helps me sleep. That's worth something.
