## Entry 1 - 2025-08-09
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Had the regional partners call this morning and I could feel the whole thing slipping. The Vietnam office wants to renegotiate their revenue share, which fine, they can ask, but the way Minh framed it — presenting the new terms as a done deal in front of the whole team, slides already formatted — that's not a negotiation, that's a corner. He backed me into agreeing to "review" the proposal by Friday. Everyone on the call saw it.

Spent the rest of the morning replaying the moment. I should have cut him off. Should have said we'll discuss it offline. Instead I sat there nodding like I was considering it when really I was just blindsided. The Singapore guys were quiet, which means they noticed. Probably already talking about it in their group chat.

Called my CFO after to get the actual numbers. The Vietnam office is profitable but not indispensable. I need to figure out how to walk this back without looking like I'm retaliating. But honestly, part of me wants to fly down there next week and have the conversation face to face, in my building, at my table. Let Minh present his slides then.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals strong emotional reaction to being publicly undermined but doesn't explore what specifically about the public nature of it stung most.
"What would've been different if Minh raised it privately first?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
Everything. If he'd come to me one-on-one, I'd have heard him out, probably even agreed to some of it. The numbers aren't unreasonable. It's the staging of it that I can't let stand. You don't ambush the person who signs your contracts.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-10
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Booked the flight to Ho Chi Minh City for Tuesday. Told Minh I want to walk the warehouse floor and review Q3 ops in person. Didn't mention the revenue share. Let him wonder.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-14
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Back from Vietnam. The meeting went how I wanted — Minh pulled back to a five-percent adjustment instead of twelve, and I agreed on the spot so it looked generous. Shook hands in front of his team. I even took everyone to dinner after at that French place on Dong Khoi. Good evening, lots of laughing, Minh's deputy told me she's glad I came down personally.

But on the flight home something kept bothering me. Minh's face when I steered the conversation. He knew exactly what I was doing. He went along with it because he had to, not because he wanted to. I got what I needed, and the office stays profitable, and the relationship is technically intact. So why does it feel like I won a hand of poker against someone who couldn't afford to fold.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry acknowledges getting the outcome he wanted but ends with discomfort he can't name — tension between the win and how it was achieved.
"You said the relationship is 'technically intact' — what's the non-technical version?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
Minh will do what I need him to do. But the next time he has a real problem — something going wrong on the ground — I'm probably the last person he calls. That's the non-technical version.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-21
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Alumni dinner last night went well. Three founders from the 2018 cohort asked me to mentor their series B pitch. Felt good to be the one they came to, specifically because they'd heard I don't sugarcoat.

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-25
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Soyeon called from Zurich this morning, first time in two weeks. She sounded fine, talked about her roommate and some lake trip the school organized. Normal teenage stuff. But she didn't ask about home. Not about her mother, not about the dog, nothing. Just called to tell me she needed the tuition wire for the supplementary program, and could I do it today.

I did it immediately, obviously. Opened the banking app while we were still on the phone, confirmed the transfer, told her it was done. She said thanks, appa, and hung up. The whole call was maybe four minutes.

My wife would say this is exactly what she warned about — that sending Soyeon away was about my idea of what her life should look like, not hers. And maybe she's right that the school is more about the name and the network than what Soyeon actually needs at sixteen. But I also know what doors open when you have that name on your transcript. I know because I didn't have it and I spent ten years kicking down doors that would have just opened.

Sitting here now after the call, I keep thinking about the four minutes. She got what she needed and hung up. Efficient. I taught her that, I think.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry ends on an ambiguous note — "I taught her that" could be pride or regret, and the entry doesn't go further.
"Is 'efficient' how you want her to be with you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
No. But I don't know how to want something different without undoing the thing I built for her. The whole point of the school, the network, all of it — it's so she never has to struggle the way I did. If the cost is that she treats me like a service provider, maybe that's just what it costs. I just didn't think it would feel like this. Like I'm being handled by my own daughter.

Kept turning over that call with Soyeon. Ended up texting her a photo of the dog sleeping on her old blanket. She sent back a heart emoji. Stupid small thing but I stared at it for a while.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-30
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Long week closing the Series C extension. Twelve-hour days, four different law firms, and a lead investor who kept changing the valuation cap at the last minute. I held the line on the terms I wanted but it took everything. By Thursday I was running on instant coffee and sheer stubbornness.

Signed this afternoon. My cofounder — well, he's technically the CTO but he still calls himself cofounder even though he came on in year three — opened a bottle of something expensive in the conference room. Everyone clapped. I said a few words, mostly thanking the team, but honestly the thing I felt most was relief. Not celebration, just the weight coming off. Went home, ate leftover jjigae standing at the kitchen counter, and now I'm sitting on the couch and I can't even turn on the TV. Just tired in a way sleep probably won't fix.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry describes a major milestone but the emotional response is flat exhaustion rather than satisfaction — worth exploring the gap.
"What would celebrating actually look like for you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
I honestly don't know anymore. Used to be it was the next deal, the next target. Right now I think it would be someone saying, unprompted, that I did well. Not the team clapping because they're supposed to. Just one person who gets what it took.
