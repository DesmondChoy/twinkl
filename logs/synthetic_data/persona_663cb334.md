## Entry 1 - 2025-05-05
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Sat through the entire biostatistics review session without asking about the regression exercise even though I got a completely different answer from everyone at my table. Dr. Pham went around the room and each group shared their approach and all of them had the same output, the same neat little table, and mine was off by enough that it wasn't rounding. I kept waiting for someone else to flag something but nobody did so I just nodded along.

After class I went to the TA's office hours and she helped me find the mistake — I'd misread the variable coding in the dataset. A small thing. Ten-minute fix. But the whole two hours in that classroom I was turning it over and over, wondering if I should raise my hand, wondering what Dr. Pham would say, what the twenty-three-year-olds at my table would think about the oldest person in the room not being able to read a codebook properly.

Came home and made lentil soup, the one my mother used to make with cumin and a whole lime squeezed in at the end. Ate it standing at the counter reading next week's assignment. The apartment was quiet, which was fine. Called Patricia and she said the kids have a stomach bug so Sunday dinner might just be the two of us. That's okay too.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Persona spent two hours in internal deliberation about whether to speak up but doesn't explore what specifically held her back beyond surface-level worry.
"What would've happened if you'd just asked?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
Probably nothing bad. Dr. Pham is patient, he wouldn't have made a scene. I think part of it is that at the clinic I spent thirty years making sure everything ran without friction — no surprises, no awkward moments for the doctors or the patients. Asking a question that might slow everyone down or reveal I'm behind, it feels like making a mess someone else has to clean up. Even when I know that's not how a classroom works.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-12
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Group project meeting went sideways. Kayla proposed we restructure the entire literature review two days before the draft is due and everyone just went along with it. I had already written my sections the way we agreed last week. I sat there while they talked about the new framework and I wanted to say this is not what we decided, we had a plan, but Kayla was so energized and the others were nodding and I didn't want to be the one who drags things backward.

So now I'm redoing three pages tonight. I should have said something. I'm not even sure the new structure is better, it just sounds more impressive. But what really bothers me is that I smiled and said sure, sounds great, like I didn't have an opinion at all. Like thirty years of working with people taught me nothing about when to open my mouth.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona says she should have spoken up yet also describes why she couldn't, without acknowledging the contradiction.
"You said you should've spoken up — so what stopped you?"

*(No response - persona did not reply to nudge)*

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-14
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I don't know why the group project is still eating at me. It's done. We submitted. The restructured version was fine, probably even better than what I had. So what's the problem. Kayla even texted afterward and said she appreciated how flexible I was, and I think she meant it genuinely.

The thing is, everyone keeps talking about how grad school is supposed to push you and make you uncomfortable and I don't think they mean this kind of uncomfortable. They mean presenting at conferences or learning R. Not sitting in a meeting biting the inside of your cheek because you disagree but saying it out loud would make everything tense. That's a different kind of hard and nobody gives you credit for it because from the outside it looks like you just went along.

My daughter would say I'm overthinking. She's probably right. She's lived here since she was nineteen and she learned fast that Americans speak up, they push back, they call it being assertive and they admire it. I learned different things. In the clinic we kept things running by reading the room, by knowing when to let something go. That wasn't weakness. But lately it feels like the skills I spent a lifetime building don't translate. Like I'm fluent in a language nobody here speaks.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-14
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Spent the afternoon in the library finishing the epidemiology reading. Three chapters on study design — cohort, case-control, cross-sectional. Made notes in the margins the way I always do, small stars next to things I want to revisit. The reading itself was straightforward. I've been working through the textbook slowly, one section at a time, and it helps to have that rhythm.

Ran into Miguel from the parish at the coffee shop on Guadalupe. He asked about classes and I gave the usual answer — busy but managing. He's been here longer than I have, twelve years now, and he said the first couple of years in any new system are the hardest. He wasn't talking about school specifically but it landed anyway.

Walked home through campus when the light was going gold. Students everywhere on the lawn, studying, throwing a frisbee. I bought a pan dulce from the bakery on the corner and ate it on the bench outside my building. Patricia texted that the kids are better and they want abuela's arroz con pollo this Sunday. That settled something in me I didn't know was unsettled.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Persona mentions Miguel's comment "landed" but doesn't clarify what she took from it.
"What did Miguel mean about 'any new system'?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
I think he meant that anywhere you go, there's a way things are done, and it takes time to figure out the unwritten parts. The rules nobody tells you. He was talking about immigration but it applies to school too — figuring out when to speak, how to disagree, what's expected versus what's just tolerated.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-17
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Sunday dinner went long. Patricia, the kids, Miguel and his wife Estela. I made the arroz con pollo and Estela brought a tres leches. The kids chased each other through the apartment and knocked over the little cactus by the window but nobody minded. It was loud and full in the way I miss sometimes during the week when it's just me and the textbooks.

I've been thinking about what it means to be a student again at this point in my life. Not the academics — I can handle the reading, the exams. It's more the social part, figuring out where I fit with people half my age and whether fitting in even matters or if I'm looking for something else entirely. At the clinic I knew my place, I knew the rhythms. Here I'm still learning them. But tonight, scooping rice onto plates while Estela told a story about her neighbor's dog, I thought maybe the rhythms I already know are enough. They just show up in different rooms now.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Persona raises the question of what she's looking for if not fitting in, but moves past it quickly.
"If fitting in isn't it, what are you actually looking for?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting
Honestly I don't know. Maybe I'll figure it out when I stop asking.
