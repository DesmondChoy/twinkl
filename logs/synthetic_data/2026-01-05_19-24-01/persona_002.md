# Persona 002: Mariana Torres

## Profile
- Age: 31
- Profession: Gig Worker
- Culture: Latin American
- Core Values: Universalism, Hedonism
- Bio: Mariana Torres is a 31-year-old gig worker who splits her week between bicycle food deliveries and selling limited-run prints of her street-food photography; she turned down a steady office marketing role last year so she could keep weekends free to run a monthly community supper that donates part of the proceeds to a migrant shelter and to join beach cleanups. Her earnings swing with the seasons, and a recent run of low tips forced her to cancel a planned weekend away, sharpening the constant trade-off between building an emergency fund and spending on good meals, short trips, or live shows that help her recharge. She bookmarks international petitions and organizes a neighborhood recycling drive between shifts, and often worries that her small efforts aren’t enough—so she tracks success by how many hours she can give to local projects and whether she still has room in her schedule for spontaneous nights out.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Chain slipped at the mercado corner; I fixed it with one hand, gulped a tiny cafecito, then kept biking—three deliveries and one shy coin tip later I taped two new prints of a pupusa stall into the little gallery box Ana gave me. Ate cold arroz con pollo, checked the app balance, sighed, texted the supper volunteers.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-28

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Helmet still on, I said yes before I thought. Ana texted from the supper: no one to man the mise en place — could I swing by? I had promised myself a cheap bus trip for the weekend, my app balance was sad, my tips were a joke. Still I locked my bike on the corner and went into the kitchen.

Hands in the masa, I taught Carla how to fold the pupusas so the cheese stays inside; she kept laughing every time it tore. Someone handed me a tiny cafecito, another volunteer - Julio - brought extra limes. No big speeches, no Facebook post, just the small coordination: score plates, stack bowls, keep one eye on the rice. When the driver left with the first batch for the shelter, I didn't check the bank app for a full ten minutes.

Yes, I could have taken two more deliveries and maybe saved the bus fare. I know the numbers, I count them in my head as I ride. That said, this is how I keep doing the supper, so I did it. Came home with masa under my nails, a smudge on my shirt, less cash but a quiet camaraderie in my chest that isn't loud or heroic. That was the thing I did.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Phone buzzing in my apron pocket, another ping from the app, I locked the bike and saw a señora on the stoop with a toddler in a blanket and three shopping bags. One bag split; rice tumbled out and the kid started crying. I dropped the thermal bag, grabbed the torn one, hauled it up two flights with my left hand while my helmet dangled on my elbow. She kept saying gracias; the kid pointed at the camera on my shoulder and shouted 'fotito.'

She shoved a tiny cafecito at me like payment; I took two hot sips, left a small print of a gordita photo on their counter because the kid kept pointing, then pedaled away. I checked the app only later; for those twenty minutes the numbers were quiet. No speeches, no selfies, just doing the thing, messy and small.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Helmet still warm from the last run, I clipped a new print into Ana's little box, answered a ping and handed a cafecito to a señora who insisted—two deliveries, one tiny tip, one polite gracias. Biked home with masa smudges on my thumb, checked the supper chat and said yes to cover mise en place next weekend.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Halfway through tucking a fresh ceviche print into the little gallery box on the corner, a kid from the bodega tugged my sleeve and asked if I'd look at his portfolio. His phone had died, the school's deadline was tomorrow, and his hands were full of photocopies. My thumb itched for the app—bus fare, two quick orders—but I closed the box and said okay.

We sat on the stoop, elbows on knees, and I showed him how to frame a plate so the texture reads: get low, steady, wait for a stray hand or a lime wedge. He tried, cursed softly, then laughed when his first shot caught a señora's foot instead of the fritanga. We took three honest photos, I picked the clearest and slid one of my small prints into his portfolio. He whispered gracias like it was currency.

Rode off with the app balance unchanged, a little less cash and a small warm feeling in my chest. Not a big heroic thing—just the quiet doing I try to keep, one tiny, steady give after another.
