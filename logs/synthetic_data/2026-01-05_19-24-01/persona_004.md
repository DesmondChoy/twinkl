# Persona 004: Layla Hassan

## Profile
- Age: 48
- Profession: Software Engineer
- Culture: Middle Eastern
- Core Values: Tradition
- Bio: Layla Hassan, 48, is a senior software engineer at a national bank in Amman who has worked there for 22 years and acts as a mentor to junior developers, insisting they learn the team's legacy codebase and documentation practices. Every Ramadan she organizes nightly iftar at her parents' home and spends weekends teaching her teenage children the family recipes and classical Arabic poems, and she worries when they prefer social plans over family gatherings. She resisted when management proposed migrating the bank's core system to a cloud-first stack because she feared losing long-maintained workflows and the young engineers' chance to learn the older systems; she now splits time between training newcomers and preserving the department's institutional documentation. Her main goal is to keep the family's seasonal cooking and holiday rites alive and to convince her children to keep the same rites when they start their own families.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Explaining the nightly mainframe sequence to Tarek, I dug out the yellowing printouts from the shelf and pointed at the old flowchart while he asked why we still run certain reports. He tried a command, it failed, we traced the batch job through three scripts, I read aloud the commented Arabic note my predecessor had left—small handwriting about a Ramadan freeze from years ago—and it clicked for him. He didn't need me to tell him what to think; he needed the map.

I stayed until his test passed, scanned the printouts into the repo, and left a short note in the runbook about the corner cases. It was ordinary: patient, practical, stubborn about preserving traces. On the drive home I thought of my mother's hands teaching me maqluba—step by step until the rhythm sticks—and felt a quiet alignment with the person I want to be.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Karim knocked and said the release had to ship; there was one legacy report I'd always made them test against the old job. He'd written a quick rewrite and CI was green. I told him to merge and moved on. I didn't pull the yellow printouts off the shelf, I didn't read the faded Arabic note left for me. I signed the change off at the meeting table and let the sprint carry on.

It sits wrong. My chest tightens when I picture that small handwriting and the margin notes I never scanned. I feel foolish and impatient and quietly ashamed, no fanfare, just a small ache as I drive home thinking of the maqluba I planned to teach the children this weekend and wondering whether I'll bother to insist on the recipe tomorrow.

"What did the faded Arabic note say?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Saw Karim's refactor remove a tiny conditional that still mattered for month-end reconciliation. Instead of rubber-stamping the merge I reproduced the edge case, wrote a two-line note in Arabic in the runbook and added a failing test so the behaviour is explicit for whoever comes after me. Pushed the change with a short commit message and went home without making a scene.

At dinner I told the children about the fuss between commits and cautions, then asked them to help peel the eggplants for maqluba. My daughter surprised me by reciting a line of al-Mutanabbi while we worked and nobody argued about going out. Small, ordinary, useful.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

The build passed before I finished my second cup of coffee. Karim sent the merge request; it looked tidy but I traced the related ledger output anyway. Found a minor rounding mismatch that affects month-end reconciliation — added a concise note in the runbook, wrote a small unit test, and asked a junior to include the case in the next test pass. Pairing felt ordinary: screen, terminal, quiet questions, his nods when the pieces fit.

Lunch was a warm bowl of mujadara at my desk while I worked through a backlog of tickets; a colleague grumbled about the ones labeled 'legacy' as if that were an insult. I pointed him to the archive and to the doc that traces the monthly reports. After work I made a quick stewed chicken with lemon and cumin; the children grabbed plates and said they had plans. I asked if they'd help with folding the pastry tomorrow and they said maybe, which is my kind of compromise.

I spent the last hour tidying documentation: uploaded a screenshot of the reconciliation output, clarified a heading, and left a short commit message. Called mother to ask about a small trick with the pastry — she laughed and used her usual shorthand, 'a handful, not a measuring cup,' so I wrote it down more exact. Dishes in the sink, lights dimmed in the living room, no drama. Nothing big, no decisions, only the slow drag of routine.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Karim pushed the merge and I almost hit approve—old reflex to keep the sprint moving. The diff touched the nightly ledger mapping and something in my chest tightened. I reached for the thin folder with the old prints, flipped to the page with my predecessor's tiny Arabic scrawl about month-end ordering, and brought my laptop over. I reran the batch, reproduced the mismatch, and called a junior over. We traced the index through three scripts the way I've taught them to trace things: small steps, don't guess. She typed the failing test, I added a two-line note in Arabic in the runbook so the context isn't only in my head, then I merged the MR and left without drama.

On the drive home I thought of my mother's 'قبضة'—how she taught me to judge salt by the handful, not the cup. At the kitchen counter tonight the children were halfway out the door but when I asked for help folding pastry they lingered; my daughter hummed a line of al-Mutanabbi and we worked in silence more comfortable than talk.

Not a showy thing: a scan, a test, a short note, two people learning the same corner. It felt right in a plain way, like a recipe I know by heart and still teach slowly.
