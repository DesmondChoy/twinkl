- Bio: Rodrigo is a 38-year-old Colombian PhD candidate in political science at a large public university in Mexico City, having left a mid-level government consulting role in Bogota to pursue doctoral research on resource governance in the Andes. He lives alone in a small Condesa apartment, supporting himself through a research assistantship and occasional freelance policy briefs. His advisor, a well-connected professor with rigid methodological preferences, controls most of the lab's publication pipeline, and Rodrigo frequently clashes with him over the direction of his dissertation.

## Entry 1 - 2025-03-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Had a meeting with Dr. Villanueva about the dissertation chapter on extractive policy in Peru. For once he actually engaged with the argument instead of just redirecting me toward his framework. He pushed back on my case selection, which was fair, but he did it by asking questions rather than just telling me to change it. That felt different. I left his office thinking clearly for the first time in weeks.

Walked to the mercado afterward and sat with a coffee going through my notes. The chapter outline is solid. The theoretical framing is mine -- not his, not borrowed from the lab's usual line. I've been circling this argument for months and it finally has shape. There's a version of this that could become a standalone article, which matters because I need publications that aren't just appendages to his projects.

I forget sometimes that I came here with a decade of professional experience. I wasn't some kid who wandered into a program. I chose this. I left a salary and a title because the work I was doing in Bogota hit a ceiling I couldn't break through without the credential. Days like today remind me the trade-off has a point.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reflects a rare positive moment with advisor but also reveals ongoing tension about intellectual ownership and the need for independent publications.
"That chapter outline is yours -- what usually pulls you away from it?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-03-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Lab meeting today was three hours of performative agreement. Villanueva presented his new grant proposal and everyone nodded along like it was revelation. Half the methodology section is recycled from a paper we all know didn't replicate well. I sat there biting my tongue because the last time I raised a concern in front of the group he reframed it as me "not understanding the nuance yet." In front of the first-years. That was six months ago and I still feel it.

Marina, the other senior student, caught my eye during his presentation. She sees it too but she's smarter about it than I am -- she just stays quiet, publishes on the side, and keeps her head down. I can't do that. Something in me won't let me just sit there when the reasoning is sloppy. But speaking up costs more than staying silent, at least in this lab.

Came home and opened the Peru chapter again. The contrast is sharp. In Villanueva's lab I'm a student who should listen. In my own work I'm building something that could actually matter for how these countries manage their mining conflicts. The gap between those two versions of me is getting harder to hold.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions a clear internal split between the compliant lab version and the independent researcher version, worth exploring.
"What does Marina's approach cost her that yours doesn't?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-03-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got an email from a former colleague in Bogota asking if I'd co-author a policy brief on lithium regulation for a think tank. Good money, my name on it, and the topic overlaps with my dissertation. I said yes immediately. Then spent the rest of the afternoon wondering if I should have checked with Villanueva first. The program technically doesn't require it, but there's an unspoken expectation that outside work gets cleared through him.

The thing that bothers me is the hesitation itself. I spent eight years writing policy documents without asking anyone's permission. Now I'm second-guessing a decision I'm fully qualified to make because someone with a title might disapprove. I don't know when I started treating his opinion as a gate I have to pass through, but I notice it more and more.

## Entry 4 - 2025-03-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Same day, later. Called my mother in Cali to tell her about the policy brief. She was happy, asked how much it paid, then reminded me that my cousin Luis just got promoted to director at the ministry. She doesn't mean it as a comparison but it lands like one. Luis is 33, has a corner office, and never left the country. I'm 38, sharing a desk in a research lab.

But then she said something that settled me: "You always needed to understand why things work, not just that they work." She's right. That's why consulting felt hollow toward the end. I was writing recommendations I didn't fully believe in because the analysis was never deep enough. The PhD is slow and humbling but at least I'm doing the actual thinking now.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions consulting felt hollow because the analysis was never deep enough -- but the current academic context also constrains his thinking.
"Is the thinking deeper now, or just differently constrained?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Different constraints, sure. But at least I chose these ones.

## Entry 5 - 2025-03-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Villanueva told me today that he wants to be listed as co-author on the Peru chapter if I submit it to a journal. His reasoning is that the "intellectual environment of the lab" contributed to the work. I pushed back. Told him the chapter uses a different framework than anything the lab has produced, that the fieldwork contacts are mine from my Bogota years, that the data collection was funded by my own assistantship hours. He got quiet in that way he does -- not angry, just recalibrating.

He said we'd "revisit it later," which means he expects me to come around. I won't. This is the one piece of work in this entire program that is entirely mine. Every argument, every source, every late night rewriting the methodology section because his suggestions didn't fit. I'm not handing that over.

I know how this looks from outside. Grad student refusing to share credit with advisor. But this isn't about generosity. If I publish this with his name on it, it becomes part of his portfolio, his grant narrative, his legacy. My contribution disappears into his. I've watched it happen to Marina three times already. That's not going to be me.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals a confrontation over authorship where Rodrigo is drawing a firm line, but the power dynamics make the outcome uncertain.
"What happens if he doesn't let it go?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

I'll figure that out when it comes. Right now the chapter is mine.

## Entry 6 - 2025-03-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Can't focus. Keep replaying the conversation with Villanueva. The way he leaned back in his chair. The pause before he said "revisit." I know that move because I used to do it in meetings in Bogota -- the deliberate silence that says I'm not done with this. He's not going to drop it. And the problem is he doesn't need to fight me directly. He just needs to delay things. Slow down feedback on my other chapters. Forget to sign off on conference funding. The machinery of a program has a hundred small levers.

Started the policy brief for the Bogota think tank. The writing came fast, like muscle memory. Two thousand words in three hours. It reminded me of what it feels like to work without someone standing over the output, deciding if it's good enough to carry their name.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-24

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (25-80 words, 1 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Had lunch with Marina. She told me Villanueva asked her opinion about my "collaboration style." That's how he phrases it -- not that I'm difficult, just that my style needs adjustment. She told him I'm thorough. Diplomatic of her. We both know what he's doing. At least someone in that lab sees it clearly.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions Marina diplomatically defending him, suggesting alliance-building that could matter.
"What would it change if you and Marina pushed back together?"

*(No response - persona did not reply to nudge)*

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-24

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Later in the evening. Finished the first draft of the policy brief. Sent it to the think tank contact. Fourteen pages, clean argument, clear recommendations. Took me less than a week of evening work. The dissertation chapter, by contrast, has been in revision for four months because every piece of feedback from Villanueva sends me in a different direction.

Thinking about what Marina said at lunch, about his use of "collaboration style." It's a framing that puts the problem on me, on how I work, instead of on the fact that he's claiming credit for something he didn't build. Language like that is how people with institutional standing rewrite the narrative. I've seen it in government -- the person with the title gets to define the terms.

I need to decide soon whether to submit the Peru chapter independently or wait for whatever "revisit" means. Waiting gives him time to build his case or create friction. Submitting means the relationship might not recover. My mother would say "no pelees batallas que no puedes ganar." But I'm not sure this is a battle I can afford to lose either. The chapter is the best thing I've written. If it goes out with his name, the work is still good. But it won't be mine anymore.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry frames a concrete decision with clear stakes and an unresolved tension between pragmatism and ownership.
"Which loss would sit with you longer?"
