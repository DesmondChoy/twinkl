# Persona 003: Priya Venkataraman

## Profile
- Age: 18-24 (22)
- Profession: Grad Student
- Culture: South Asian
- Core Values: Tradition, Conformity
- Bio: Priya is pursuing her Master's in Computer Science at a university three hours from her family home in Chennai, close enough that her parents expect weekend visits for temple and Sunday lunch with her grandparents. She chose her research specialization partly because her father's colleague could supervise her, honoring a family connection her parents had quietly arranged. Lately she has been struggling with a labmate who keeps pushing her to speak up more in group meetings, which makes her stomach knot because she was raised to let senior students lead discussions.

Skipped the video call with Paati tonight because the lab meeting ran late and I just—didn't call back after. She waits by the phone every Saturday at 7. I could have stepped out of the meeting, nobody would have cared, but I didn't want to be the one to interrupt Dr. Rao mid-sentence. Now it's too late to call and I keep seeing her sitting there.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Random elaboration gate passed

"What held you back from stepping out?"

### Response
I don't know, it's not a big deal really. The meeting was important.

Called Paati during my lunch break today. Didn't wait for the weekend, didn't overthink it. She picked up on the second ring and I could hear her adjusting her hearing aid, then that little laugh she does when she's surprised. We talked for maybe twelve minutes about nothing—her mango pickle batch, whether the jasmine by the front gate is blooming yet, how my uncle's knee is doing after his fall. She asked if I was eating enough and I said yes even though I had skipped breakfast again.

When I hung up I felt like something had unclenched in my chest. Not fixed, exactly. But I had done the thing I said I would do. I ate my cold idli standing in the hallway outside the lab and it tasted fine.

Thursday. The kind of day that just passes through you without leaving much behind. Woke up ten minutes before my alarm, lay there listening to the construction noise from the new building they're putting up behind the hostel. Made coffee in the common room, the instant kind that tastes vaguely of cardboard but does its job. Went to the lab, debugged the same piece of code I've been staring at since Monday. Meera brought samosas from that place near the bus stand—the good ones with the crispy edges. We ate them over the keyboard, which Professor would hate if he knew.

Called home during the afternoon slump, around 4:30. Amma picked up and talked about the jasmine plant on the balcony finally flowering, how she's saving the first string for the Lakshmi puja next week. I could hear Appa in the background asking if I'm eating properly. The usual. I said yes, which is mostly true. Paati wasn't there—apparently she'd gone to Mrs. Krishnamurthy's place next door to watch some serial together. I felt oddly relieved not having to talk, then felt bad about feeling relieved.

Walked back to the hostel as it got dark. The sky was that particular shade of grey-pink that happens in November. Bought a packet of biscuits from the corner shop. The shopkeeper's daughter was doing homework at the counter, tongue sticking out in concentration. Nothing really happened today. Just hours moving forward, one after another.

Vikram cornered me after the meeting today, said I need to 'own my space' more when presenting results. I just nodded and smiled and said I'd work on it. The thing is he's not wrong. I barely said ten words in that whole hour. But something about the way he said it—like he was doing me this huge favor by pointing out my obvious inadequacy—made me want to disappear into the floor tiles.

I called Amma after and she asked how my day was and I said fine. Just fine. Didn't mention Vikram, didn't mention how small I felt. She was telling me about the kolam competition at the temple and I kept saying mm-hmm, mm-hmm, waiting for her to finish so I could hang up. I don't know why I called if I wasn't going to actually talk. Now it's 11 PM and I'm picking at cold rice and feeling like I failed at two conversations in one day.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Hedging language detected in unsettled entry

"What made you say 'just fine'?"

### Response
I don't know, it just came out? She sounded tired and I didn't want to add to her plate. Also what would I even say - 'Amma, someone told me to be more confident and I just stood there like an idiot'? That's not really a problem worth discussing. She has enough going on.

Group meeting today. Dr. Ramachandran asked for input on the dataset preprocessing approach and I had this whole thought about why the current method might introduce bias. Vikram was literally looking at me. I just nodded along with what Sneha suggested instead. It was fine, her idea was fine. But I knew mine was different and possibly better and I just... didn't.

Afterwards Vikram didn't say anything which was almost worse than if he had. Appa called in the evening to check on my progress and I told him everything was going smoothly with the project. Which is true technically. The project is fine. I'm the one who keeps folding myself into smaller shapes so I don't take up room. Ate dinner alone in my room, didn't feel like sitting in the common area.
