# Persona 004: Henrik Lindqvist

## Profile
- Age: 45-54
- Profession: Entrepreneur
- Culture: Western European
- Core Values: Power
- Bio: Henrik founded a logistics software company in Stockholm twelve years ago and grew it to 200 employees before selling a majority stake to a private equity firm last year. He retained the CEO title but now reports to a board that second-guesses his decisions, and the friction is wearing on him. His ex-wife has primary custody of their two teenagers, and he sees them every other weekend in the house he bought specifically to be closer to their school. He is currently negotiating to acquire a smaller competitor, partly to prove to the new board that he still calls the shots.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Spent most of the morning on calls about the Bremer deal. Legal is dragging their feet on the due diligence timeline, which means I had to loop in Marcus again to push things along. He's good at that, getting people to move. I should probably delegate more to him but I don't trust the details to land right unless I'm watching.

Lunch was at the usual place near the office. The owner knows my order by now, which is a small thing but I appreciate it. Drove past the house where the kids stay on my way back. No reason, just the route I took. Tomorrow I have the board prep call, which will be fine. They'll ask about Q4 projections and I'll have the numbers ready.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The board wanted me to pause the Bremer acquisition until Q1. Said they needed more time to review the financials, wanted to bring in their own analyst. I said fine. Just like that. Didn't push back, didn't remind them that I've been doing deals like this since before half of them knew what EBITDA stood for. Marcus looked at me after the call like he expected me to say something, but I just closed my laptop and told him we'd regroup Thursday.

I keep telling myself it's strategy. Pick your battles. But I drove home and sat in the car for ten minutes before going inside. The house was dark, obviously—kids aren't here until Friday. I don't know why I agreed so quickly. It's not like me. Or maybe it is now. Maybe that's what bothers me.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Hedging language ("fine") detected in unsettled entry

"What made you stay in the car?"

### Response
Honestly? I didn't want to walk into an empty house and hear my own footsteps. That sound. It's louder when you know no one's coming home. I used to work 14-hour days and the quiet was a reward. Now it just reminds me that I traded something for all this. Still not sure what exactly. But it was something.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-09

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Kids came over this weekend. Lina was stressed about a biology test so I sat with her at the kitchen table for two hours going over cell division. Didn't check my phone once. When she finally got it, she said 'thanks, pappa' and it was the first thing in weeks that felt like it mattered.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Grey morning. The coffee machine at the office broke again and I walked down to the café on Sveavägen instead of asking someone to fix it. The barista recognized me, which surprised me—I haven't been there in months. She asked if I wanted the usual. I said yes even though I couldn't remember what my usual was. Turned out to be an americano with oat milk. Apparently that's who I am now.

Back at the desk I spent most of the day reviewing the Q4 forecasts. Numbers look fine. Not great, not worrying. The kind of numbers that don't require any decisions from me. I caught myself staring at the window for a while, watching the rain. Used to think rain days were wasted days. Now I just notice them.

Had a short call with Erik and Lina before dinner. They were doing homework, distracted. Lina mentioned something about a friend's party this weekend. I said that sounds fun. She said yeah. That was the whole conversation. I ordered Thai food and ate it at the kitchen counter while reading about some merger in the news. Went to bed around eleven. Nothing happened today. I'm not sure why I'm writing this down except that it felt like the kind of day I should remember—ordinary, quiet, mine.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Board call ran long, Marcus pushing again on the Q1 targets. I said what I actually thought instead of what would end the meeting faster. Nobody agreed with me but I didn't backtrack either. Drove home with the radio off. Felt solid, like I used to.
