## Entry 1 - 2025-06-06

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Got the renewal confirmation from Formosa Plastics this afternoon. Three-year contract extension, same volume, small price adjustment we can absorb. I sat with the letter for a while before telling anyone. Twenty-three years of this company and these moments still feel like exhaling after holding your breath. The terms are not exciting. No growth clause, no expanded scope. But when I walked through the warehouse floor afterward, I counted the stations — forty-two people whose paychecks run through what I decide. That number has not changed in four years and I am fine with that.

My son Jia-hao asked why I did not push for a bigger increase in the unit price. He pulled up competitor rates and showed me a spreadsheet. He is sharp, I will give him that. But he has not sat across from a procurement manager who controls a quarter of your annual revenue and watched them consider whether you are worth the trouble. You do not squeeze someone who keeps coming back. You make it easy for them to stay.

Mei-ling and I had tea after dinner and she said I looked lighter than I have in weeks. She is right. A locked-in contract means the next three years have a floor under them, and that matters more to me than a ceiling I might not reach.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions his son's challenge about pricing but cuts off the exchange quickly, potential depth about generational tension in the business
"What did Jia-hao say after that?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-06-06

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Second time writing today, which I almost never do. After the tea with Mei-ling I went back to my study to look over the Q3 projections and ended up just sitting there. Not anxious, not relieved — more like noticing the room. The desk lamp I have had since the company's first year. The filing cabinet that still has paper copies of our original business registration. Mei-ling keeps telling me to digitize everything but there is something about opening a drawer and seeing the actual stamps on the actual paper.

I called my younger brother Weijun in Kaohsiung. He asked about the Formosa deal and I told him it went through. He said congratulations and then started talking about his daughter's wedding plans. Normal conversation. But I realized I had called him specifically so someone outside the company would know the ground is solid. Like I needed a witness. Not sure what that is about. Maybe just habit — our father always reported good news to the family first, bad news never.

The neighborhood was quiet tonight. Mrs. Lin across the alley had her laundry out late again. I can see it from my study window. Small things like that — the rhythm of the block staying the same — I notice them more than I used to.

## Entry 3 - 2025-06-09

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Had lunch with old colleague Lao Zhang today. We worked together at the engineering firm before I left to start the company. He retired last year from the same desk he sat at for thirty-one years. Full pension, government health coverage, the works. We ate at the beef noodle place on Zhongxiao East Road that has not changed its menu since we were in our thirties.

He told me he is bored. Gets up, reads the paper, watches his grandchildren on video calls, goes to bed. Said he envies me for still having something to wake up for. I told him I envy his pension. We both laughed but I think we both meant it. The difference is I chose the path where nothing is guaranteed month to month, and some part of me has never fully forgiven myself for that, even though the company has been stable for over a decade. I still check the accounts receivable every Monday morning before anyone else arrives.

I suppose that lunch reminded me why I keep the reserve fund where it is, even when Jia-hao argues we should reinvest. Lao Zhang's safety net was built into his employment. Mine I had to build by hand, brick by brick, and if I pull bricks out to build something taller, the foundation gets thinner.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Admits he has "never fully forgiven himself" for choosing entrepreneurship over guaranteed employment, hedging between pride and regret
"What would it take for you to forgive that choice?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Honestly, I do not think I can. The choice was right — the company employs forty-two families. But the version of me that wanted a predictable life, that version does not care about being right. He just wanted to stop worrying. And I still have not given him that.

## Entry 4 - 2025-06-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Jia-hao came to me with a proposal to take on a new product line — biodegradable packaging for the food service sector. He had the whole pitch: market research, supplier contacts, projected margins. Spent weeks on it apparently. And the numbers looked reasonable on paper. But "reasonable on paper" and "reasonable when you are the one signing the purchase orders" are different things entirely.

I told him we would revisit it after the Formosa contract settles in. He did not argue but I could see the frustration. He walked out of my office the way I used to walk out of my father's study — jaw tight, hands in pockets. I know what that walk means. But I also know what happens when you stretch into a new market before you have confirmed your existing revenue is truly locked down. I have seen it take companies apart. I am not going to let that happen to ours.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions seeing his son's frustration but quickly pivots to justification, the emotional exchange is left unexplored
"Did you tell him any of that?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-06-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Mei-ling brought it up after dinner. She thinks I was too quick to shut Jia-hao down this morning. She did not say it that way — she said maybe I should look at the proposal more carefully before deciding. But I know what she means. She has been the translator between me and the children for decades.

She also mentioned that Jia-hao talked to her about possibly starting his own company if there is no room for his ideas here. She said it casually, while washing dishes. I do not think it was casual. I told her I would read the proposal again this weekend. Then I went to my study and closed the door.

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Spent the weekend with Jia-hao's proposal spread across my desk. Read it three times. The margins are tighter than he presented — I found some cost assumptions that do not account for certification delays in biodegradable materials, which can take six to eight months in Taiwan. But the core idea is sound. The food service sector is moving that direction whether we participate or not.

I kept thinking about what Mei-ling said, about him starting his own thing. My father ran a hardware store in Tainan for forty years. Same location, same inventory categories, same suppliers. When I told him I was leaving the engineering firm to start my own company, he did not speak to me for two weeks. Not out of anger — he genuinely could not understand why anyone would walk away from a monthly salary. I swore I would never do that to my children. And here I am, not refusing to speak, but maybe doing something worse — keeping him inside a structure that is shaped entirely around how I see the world.

I circled three sections of his proposal where the numbers need work and left it on his desk with a note that said "Let's talk Monday." That is further than I wanted to go. But the alternative — watching him leave the way I left my father's orbit — I cannot do that either. I keep turning it over. I agreed to look, not to leap. But I am not sure the distinction matters to anyone but me.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Expresses deep internal conflict between maintaining control and risking his son's departure, hedging with "further than I wanted to go" and uncertainty about whether his compromise is genuine
"Are you opening the door or just cracking it?"
