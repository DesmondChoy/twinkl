# Persona 004: Riya Kapur

## Profile
- Age: 29
- Profession: Gig Worker
- Culture: South Asian
- Core Values: Self-Direction
- Bio: Riya Kapur grew up in a middle-class family in Pune and turned down a campus-placement software job to keep a flexible schedule; she now works full weeks as a rideshare and food-delivery driver while spending evenings developing a travel-planning web app and photographing local markets to sell as prints. She gets frustrated when the delivery platform changes routing and rating rules overnight or when relatives pressure her to take a steady office job, and unpredictable pay means she checks a tight monthly spreadsheet to make rent and occasional trips home. Small wins—her first paid print sale, a friend installing the beta of her app—keep her building on nights and weekends despite the financial and social trade-offs.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

At the paithani stall behind the fruit seller, tai asked if I could photograph the saree and send it to her daughter in London. The delivery app was already counting down. I said yes, grabbed my camera from the trunk, knelt, took three close-ups of the zari and border, showed them on her phone, helped her pick one. She tucked a small packet of chivda into my palm and insisted I keep it. I left four minutes late and updated the extra time in my rent spreadsheet on my phone during the next red light.

No speeches, no explanations to the next passenger about why I looked dusty at pickup. It wasn't dramatic — just doing the practical, small thing I like: making photos that help someone, fitting it around the gig, keeping the spreadsheet honest. I uploaded the three files tonight and one is already marked 'print?'

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Auntie cornered me after a run and I said yes to her friend's office referral; filled out their corporate form with my old campus CV between two deliveries and accepted an interview slot because rent is due and the spreadsheet is thin. It sits wrong.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Pulled into the chai stall, paper cup sweating on the dashboard, while the app rerouted me twice and I updated the rent spreadsheet. Three short fares, a customer who asked about my camera, ₹150 in fares, then home to fix a tiny UI glitch before bed.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Random elaboration gate passed

"Did you get their contact info?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Told Auntie I'd try the office trial so I could cover rent; during onboarding I kept glancing at the trunk where my camera was, my phone buzzing with a print buyer and Ritika asking about the beta. I signed the temporary form, told them Monday, then drove three fares and closed the photos app without answering.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I said yes before I finished the sentence. HR slid a tablet across the desk and asked if I could start full-time next Monday, and whether I'd keep rides and deliveries only outside office hours. I thumbprinted the consent, thinking of the rent spreadsheet and Auntie's "finally"—it felt easier than explaining. The badge came warm from the printer; I clipped it to my bag and left.

My phone went hot with Ritika's message: 'beta ready—can you install tonight?' and with the buyer who wanted the paithani print. I typed 'sorry, tied up at work' and sent it without offering a time. I arranged for a cousin to collect the print and forwarded the payment screenshot. The camera stays wrapped in the trunk; I touched the leather strap twice before shutting the boot.

I moved a number in the spreadsheet for expected salary and stared at the column until my eyes hurt. The lanyard hangs on the hook by the door next to the packet of chivda tai insisted I take. I open the photos app, then close it. It was the simplest thing in the moment. The rest of it is messy: unpaid gigs, unsent messages, the camera unopened in the trunk.
