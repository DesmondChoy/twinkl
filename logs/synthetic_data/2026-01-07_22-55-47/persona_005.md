# Persona 005: Maya Patel

## Profile
- Age: 23
- Profession: Grad Student
- Culture: North American
- Core Values: Tradition, Stimulation
- Bio: Maya Patel, 23, is a Grad Student in cultural anthropology at a Midwestern university who grew up cooking her grandmother's Diwali sweets and still hosts the family's large holiday meal when she's home. She switched from a biology major, spent a gap year backpacking through Southeast Asia, and now takes short-term fieldwork in Oaxaca and Nova Scotia that broadens her research but means she often misses weddings and anniversaries, prompting her parents to press her toward a steady postdoc or academic job. Between recording her grandmother's recipes to teach her younger cousin and applying for last-minute fellowships or weekend climbing trips, she works to keep the family's culinary practices alive while chasing new experiences.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I agreed to teach the undergraduate ethnographic methods course when Dr. Reynolds asked in the hallway between seminars, even though I'd planned to be in Oaxaca that week. It was one sentence: "Can you cover this?" and I said yes before I processed the calendar or Grandma's text about recording the Diwali sweets. No negotiation, no asking who else might cover it. I told myself I could rearrange fieldwork; the chair moved on.

Afterward I booked the replacement flights, wrote the TA syllabus on the bus, and replied to Mom that I'd try to be home for Diwali but couldn't promise. I canceled the Friday kitchen session with my cousin where we'd film Grandma's besan laddo and notes, leaving a half-filled notebook on the counter. My inbox filled with departmental logistics and my phone lit up with Grandma's message, "Are you coming?" I left it unanswered for too long.

I can make the course work and the students will be fine. The tasks are checked off. Still, it sits wrong. I keep thinking about the half-filled notebook on the counter and Grandma's unanswered message.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-04

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Phone propped against the spice jar, recording, I sat on the counter stool while Grandma stirred the besan for laddo in the old steel pan. I asked the question I'd been avoiding: 'How do you know when it's done?' She pinched a bit between her fingers and said, 'When it holds.' I wrote 'pinch test - after 8-10 mins roast, cool slightly, add hot ghee, bind with sugar' into the half-filled notebook and kept writing until the page was full.

I didn't check my email or make excuses; I followed the sequence she gave, asked the follow-ups—how hot the pan, how finely to roast, whether to sift the sugar—and she answered in the short, exact sentences she uses for the kitchen. I shot three short clips on my phone: roasting, the pinch test, final binding, labeled them and backed them up to the cloud. Sent one clip to my cousin right away so she could see Grandma's fingers.

When I left the house the notebook was bulky in my bag and the recording folder had names instead of 'laddo_final_v2.' I still have the TA prep and flight rebooking to sort, but the recipe isn't a half-page anymore. No big revelation - just a full page and a few clear clips.

### Nudge (Elaboration)

"Did the pinch test work?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-10

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

My thumb found 'laddo_final_v2' before I could second-guess myself. Halfway through the ethnography seminar—student debate dissolving into a list of citations—I tapped play. Grandma's voice, short and exact: 'When it holds.' The tin pan clinked, the wooden spoon scraped, and for once I didn't narrate the clip into theory; I let them hear the kitchen. People leaned forward as if in a different kind of fieldsite.

I'd brought three laddos wrapped in wax paper because impulse and because one time your fieldwork is also your pantry. Quietly passed them around after the clip; hands shrugged off papers and cold coffee. Someone asked how long to roast and I said 'about eight to ten minutes, pinch test,' no hedging, no 'it depends.' Saying it like that felt like handing the work to someone who could use it — not just describing it for a grade.

I didn't take a photo. I washed my hands of flour and sugar later at the sink behind the lecture hall and kept the recording labeled the same, simple. Back in my bag the bulky notebook doesn't feel like a to-do list anymore; the page with the pinch test sits ready whenever Grandma wants to say more.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-19

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I said yes before I thought. Emma from Communications messaged—need a short audio clip for the newsletter—and I pulled up laddo_final_v2, attached it, typed a one-line caption, and hit send. It was the easiest option: no back-and-forth, no scheduling, a neat little demo for the methods class. They replied a couple of emails later with a run date. I did not call Grandma to tell her.

The newsletter went out and people stopped me in the hall saying how much they liked the kitchen sounds. I handed out a wrapped laddo, smiled, and moved on. Back at my desk the wax paper in my bag felt heavier; the recording is already somewhere public and I haven’t said anything to the person whose hands are in it. It sits wrong.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-24

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My pen died halfway through grading the undergrads' reflective memos and I looked down to find the laddo wrapped in wax paper, flattened from being buried under my notebook. The office kitchen smells faintly of reheated stuffing; someone left a half-pie with a Post-it that said 'help yourself.' I rearranged the TA schedule, replied to Emma's follow-ups about the newsletter, and tried not to think about whether Grandma would like people hearing her voice without a heads-up.

Short walk back to the car and the campus felt oddly empty—more room for people to pass, instead everyone gone home. I made a shopping list for the break: more ghee, sugar, and a replacement pen. Nothing dramatic. Just the small orbit of chores, emails, and the quiet fact that the recording is already out there and I'm moving on to the next thing.
