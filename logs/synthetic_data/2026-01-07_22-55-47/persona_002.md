# Persona 002: Minji Park

## Profile
- Age: 23
- Profession: Manager
- Culture: East Asian
- Core Values: Universalism, Tradition
- Bio: Minji Park is a 23-year-old manager at a Seoul-based social enterprise that makes biodegradable food packaging; she turned down a higher-paying offer at a multinational supplier to lead a five-person operations team and run community workshops on waste reduction. She pushes the buying team to choose verified sustainable suppliers, volunteers on weekends at a clinic for migrant workers, and spends evenings reading international reports on ocean plastics and labor rights—constant exposure to those problems leaves her restless and sometimes exhausted. At home she preserves her grandmother's recipes, prepares rice cakes for Lunar New Year, translates family letters into English, and visits her elderly aunt every Sunday, while family expectations that she help run the small noodle shop next summer make her worry about balancing community commitments with filial duties.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

The translator froze over one line at the clinic and for a second there was that awful gap, like everyone was waiting to see what I'd do. I pushed my chair closer, turned the paper so the Hangul was clear, and wrote the phrase she needed in block letters. No lecture, no pity—just a tiny checkbox drawn, a slow pronunciation, a hand on the corner until she understood. She exhaled and ticked it.

I'd been jittery all morning—UN plastics briefs on the subway, a supplier demanding a faster quote, halmeoni's noodle-shop plans tugging at the back of my head. None of that mattered at that table. I kept the silence long enough for her to find her own question. Someone else might have filled the blank and moved on; I waited straight through until the meaning landed.

When she smiled, I felt the moment sink into something domestic—the faint smell of yesterday's tteok on my bag, the memory of halmeoni shaping rice cakes with steady hands. Not a revelation, just a small proof that steady, useful gestures are possible even on tired days. I'll try to remember that shape, quietly.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My inbox demanded attention before coffee—three supplier emails, one pushing a cheaper resin; I attached the verified-supplier sheet and nudged the buying team on Slack. Stand-up ran long because the laminator jammed again; Joon and I wrestled the tray out with greasy gloves, then ate leftover kimbap on the packaging bench while reworking the production timeline. Small logistics, small compromises, nothing dramatic.

Clinic shift tonight as usual; the interpreter was late so I scribbled translations directly onto the intake form and handed it back without ceremony. On the subway I skimmed the UN plastics brief and felt that steady restlessness at the base of my skull. Halmeoni's tteok is in the fridge, aunt's call on Sunday is penciled in, and somewhere between folding uniforms and half-watching a webinar I fell asleep with my phone still open.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-10

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Slack pinged while I was slicing halmeoni's leftover tteok, and I typed a quick reply to the buyer between cuts—cheaper resin, of course. I attached the verified-supplier list, nudged the buying team on Slack, then the laminator jammed and Joon and I wrestled the tray out with greasy gloves; we ate leftover kimbap on the bench and rescheduled an afternoon run-through. Small things kept stacking: invoice signatures, a volunteer rota, a text from my aunt asking about Sunday.

Clinic shift tonight — interpreter was late so I scribbled the intake lines in block Hangul and handed the form back; the woman circled the box and breathed, quiet. On the subway I skimmed another UN plastics brief and tried not to let it crowd everything else, halmeoni's rice cakes are in the fridge, and I'm scrolling through dates for the noodle-shop conversation again though it's months away.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Random elaboration gate passed

"What did the woman say?"

### Response

She just murmured '감사합니다' with a small, relieved smile, folded the form away and nodded—no words beyond that.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-15

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I let the buying team sign with the cheaper, unverified resin to keep the shipment on schedule; I wrote 'verify later' and hit approve. Halmeoni's tteok is in the fridge, my aunt's asking about the noodle shop, and the signed contract sits on my laptop with a quiet, persistent wrongness.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Random elaboration gate passed

"Why did you hit approve?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Halfway through the call I realized my hands smelled like rice cake dough. Halmeoni's tteok still in the fridge; I'd been on the line with the buyer who wanted a fast signature for an unverified resin. Everything in me wanted to press approve and close the loop—shipment schedules, Joon's glances, the laminator needing parts—but instead I lifted my voice and asked for the audit report. Not loud, just flat. The buyer tried to redirect; I held the line.

It was small: three questions about certifications, a promise to call their factory manager, a note on Slack to pause the approve button. The team stilled, not because I performed anything heroic but because I made a choice that didn't match the easiest option. I felt tired while saying it—my throat dry, the UN brief still open on my tab—but the words felt like they belonged to the version of me who's been reading those reports at night.

After, I washed flour from my fingers, made a cup of barley tea, and didn't make a show of being proud. Halmeoni would probably tell me to stop worrying. Maybe she's right. For now it's just this: a small, steady preference—paying the extra minutes for paperwork instead of swallowing it whole.
