She donates a small percentage of each month's earnings to an ocean cleanup nonprofit and has turned down steadier design work from a fast fashion brand because she couldn't square it with herself.

## Entry 1 - 2025-07-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent all afternoon in the heat doing deliveries and my last drop-off was to this grandmother living alone in a rooftop unit with no AC. She tried to give me a banana milk from her fridge. Took it, thanked her properly the way my mom taught me, and biked home feeling like at least one interaction today was real.

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Slow day for orders so I worked on a logo draft for this small tofu shop near Mullae. The owner is from Gyeongsang-do, reminds me of my dad a bit, stubborn about everything but generous when it matters. He wants the logo to look "clean and honest," which is vague but I kind of get it. Spent two hours on it at the cafe near my place.

Between that and three deliveries I made maybe 40,000 won today. Rent is due next week. I keep doing the math and it never quite adds up but somehow it always works out. My friend Eunji keeps telling me to just take the full-time position at her company's marketing team. Stable salary, benefits, the whole package. But every time I think about sitting in an office doing campaign graphics for some supplement brand I feel this weight in my chest.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: "every time I think about sitting in an office doing campaign graphics for some supplement brand I feel this weight in my chest" - visceral reaction mentioned but unexplored
"What's the weight about?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Feeling trapped doing work I don't care about for money.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

One of the other drivers in the Coupang group chat was complaining about a Vietnamese restaurant owner being rude and someone else jumped in calling the guy a slur. I saw it happen in real time, could have said something, just kept scrolling. It's a work chat, I need these people for shift swaps.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona witnessed a slur against a migrant worker in a group chat and chose silence for practical reasons, directly contradicting her volunteer work with the same community.
"Would you have stayed quiet if it wasn't a work chat?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

It's not that simple. You don't know how these driver groups work.

Got offered a big freelance job today. A streetwear brand wants a full visual identity package, logo through social templates, decent pay, maybe 800,000 won. The catch is they source everything from factories in Myanmar and Bangladesh and make no pretense about it. Their Instagram is all "hustle culture" aesthetics and zero mention of where anything is made. I know what those supply chains look like. I've seen the documentaries, I literally help people from those countries on Saturdays.

I took the job. Told myself I need the money, which is true. Rent plus the phone bill plus I still owe Eunji for covering dinner twice last month. But sitting here now it doesn't feel like a financial decision, it feels like I just decided my bills matter more than the people sewing those clothes. And maybe they do, practically. But I hate that I didn't even hesitate that long.

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

At the community center this morning. One of the regulars, a woman from Cambodia named Sophy, was telling the group about her factory getting fined for safety violations but nothing actually changing. The Korean supervisor apparently told the workers to just "be more careful." A couple of the other volunteers kind of nodded sympathetically and moved on to the next agenda item.

I knew I should have asked more about it or at least offered to help her document the conditions. I've done that before for other people. But I was thinking about the streetwear job and how I'm literally designing branding for the same kind of supply chain she's describing. So I just sat there and let the conversation move on because engaging felt hypocritical. Like who am I to help her when I'm profiting off the same system.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona actively withdrew from helping a specific person she normally would have helped, because of guilt over the streetwear job she accepted the day before.
"Does not helping her make the streetwear thing feel better or worse?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Worse. Obviously worse.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Came back from the center and opened the streetwear brief but couldn't start. Kept thinking about Sophy's face when nobody followed up. I chose the paycheck over what I actually believe in and now I can't even do the work properly.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Same-day continuation showing the streetwear decision is actively preventing her from functioning, with explicit acknowledgment of a gap between money and belief.
"So what happens now with the job?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

Probably finish it. Knowing better doesn't change what I do.
