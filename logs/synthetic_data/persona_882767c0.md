## Entry 1 - 2025-02-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Finally told Andrés he can't keep showing up twenty minutes late to install pieces. I've been letting it slide for weeks because he's good with his hands and the clients like him, but this morning he rolled in while a collector was already waiting and I had to cover for him, again. So I pulled him aside after she left and laid it out: one more time and I'm finding someone else.

He looked genuinely startled, which tells me nobody's ever drawn that line with him. Good. I can't have my space looking disorganized when there's money on the table. Felt solid doing it, too. Not angry, just clear. The gallery is mine and the standard is mine to set.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions the collector was waiting — there's an unexplored thread about how that interaction went and whether the collector noticed.
"Did the collector say anything about the wait?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

She didn't mention it directly, but she kept checking her phone while I was making small talk. Ended up buying the smaller piece instead of the one she'd asked about originally. Could be coincidence, could be she lost patience. Either way, that's exactly why I can't let things slide.

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Long day finishing the commission for the Restrepo family. Got the last panel mounted and stepped back to look at the whole triptych together. It works. The proportions are right, the color transitions hold. I stood there for a minute just looking at it and felt something click into place, that rare moment when what I made matches what I saw in my head.

Called my mom after. She asked about the gallery rent, whether I'd paid on time. I had, obviously. I always do. She worries, but she doesn't need to — I've had the next three months covered since January. Told her the commission check clears Friday. She sounded relieved, which is enough for now.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: The moment of standing back and feeling the triptych "click" is described briefly — worth pulling on what that felt like.
"What was that click like?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-17

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Met with a potential co-investor for the expansion into the second floor. He kept talking over me, pitching his own vision for the layout. I smiled and nodded through most of it instead of pushing back, and now I'm sitting here irritated at myself.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Walked through the Saturday market in Provenza this morning, not to buy anything but just to look at how other people display their work. The ceramicist on the corner has started using linen backdrops and better lighting — she's learning. A year ago her booth looked like a garage sale. Now people stop.

I do this thing where I watch who commands a space and who just fills it. The ceramicist commands hers now. It reminded me why I fought so hard to get the gallery out of the shared lease arrangement. When I had to negotiate every wall placement with Camilo, nothing felt fully mine. Now every corner of that space reflects a decision I made, and collectors can feel it. That matters more than people think.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Lazy Sunday, which almost never happens. Woke up late, made arepas with the leftover hogao from Friday. Sat on the balcony eating and watching the street below. The neighbor's kid was kicking a ball against the wall again, steady thunk-thunk-thunk rhythm that's almost calming when you're not trying to concentrate.

Started going through my supply invoices because even on a day off I can't leave the numbers alone. Paints are up twelve percent from last year which is absurd, and I'm running through the cadmium yellow faster than usual because of the Restrepo palette. Need to either find a new supplier or adjust my pricing. Probably both. I've been meaning to rework the pricing sheet anyway — the last revision was August and costs have shifted.

Nothing urgent. The accounts are fine. I just like knowing exactly where the money sits, what's coming in, what's going out. My mother would say I got that from my father, who used to keep a paper ledger for his tire shop even after they had a computer. Different scale, same instinct.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent the afternoon finalizing the March exhibition lineup and it felt like orchestrating something, which is the part of this work I love most. Three emerging artists, each one I handpicked. Two of them came to me through referrals from collectors I've built relationships with over years. The third found me through Instagram, sent a portfolio that was raw but had something. I'm taking a risk on her, but a calculated one — I've already soft-committed two buyers who tend to go for that aesthetic.

The thing is, when I curate a show, I'm not just hanging art. I'm deciding whose career gets a platform and whose doesn't. That responsibility sits well with me. I spent years being the one hoping someone would give me a shot. Now I'm on the other side. I've earned that.

Had a good call with Daniela, my accountant, beforehand. March projections are strong, the reserve fund is untouched, insurance renewal is handled. When the financial side is solid, I can actually think about the art. When it's shaky, everything else feels shaky too. I learned that the hard way during the first year after the split with Camilo, when I was burning through savings and couldn't focus on a single canvas.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions the third artist she's taking a "calculated risk" on — there's an unexplored thread about what she saw in the portfolio.
"What was the something in her portfolio?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

Honestly, she reminded me of myself ten years ago. Same raw energy, same refusal to make the work palatable for easy sales. I almost didn't reach out because I don't usually go for sentimental reasons. But then I looked at her pieces again and they're genuinely good. I just didn't want to admit that the recognition was part of why I noticed her.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-05

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The co-investor sent a revised proposal with his name listed as "co-director" of the new floor. I didn't agree to that. I wrote back saying we need to clarify terms before anything moves forward, but my hands were shaking when I hit send. Not from fear — from the idea that someone thinks they can just slide into a title I haven't offered.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: She says her hands were shaking "not from fear" but the intensity of the reaction suggests something deeper than just annoyance.
"What were the hands shaking from, then?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Just adrenaline. It's fine. The email's sent, the boundary is drawn. Moving on.

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

March show opens Friday. All three artists delivered on time. Walked through the hung pieces this evening and everything is exactly where I placed it. Good feeling, knowing the room is set and the invitations went out to the right people.

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Opening night went better than I planned. Sold four pieces in the first two hours, including one from the new artist — the one I took a chance on. A collector from Bogotá asked for my card and said he'd been hearing my name. That sentence alone made the whole month worth it. This is what building a reputation looks like, one show at a time, one handshake at a time.

Called my mom after closing up. She asked how much I made and I told her, which I don't usually do, but I wanted her to hear it. Wanted her to know the gallery isn't some reckless bet anymore. She said "qué bueno, mija" in that tone that means she's genuinely proud but won't say it bigger than that. That's enough. The numbers are good, the reserve is intact, and people are starting to know the name Villalobos in this city's art scene.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Someone on an art forum called my curation "commercially safe." I almost replied but closed the tab instead. My gallery, my choices, my track record. If making a living from art while keeping my lights on and my artists paid is "safe," fine. I'll take it.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: She says she "almost replied" — the impulse to defend herself and the decision to close the tab suggests unresolved friction.
"What were you going to type?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Something about how I left a stable partnership to build this alone and nobody who's done that gets to be called safe. But then I realized I'd be arguing with a stranger who's never mounted a show or signed a lease. Not worth it. I know what I've built.

## Entry 11 - 2025-03-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The co-investor agreed to drop the co-director title but now wants approval rights on artist selection for the second floor. Told him I'd think about it. I won't give that up, but I also can't fund the expansion alone and the bank terms are worse. Feels like I'm slowly trading control for capital and I'm not sure where the line is.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: She explicitly says she's "not sure where the line is" — rare admission of uncertainty about control she normally guards fiercely.
"Where would the line be?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

I don't know yet. That's the whole problem. I'll figure it out before the next meeting.
