## Entry 1 - 2025-02-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Skipped the drive to Maman's yesterday. Told her the baby had a fever, which was half-true — she was warm, maybe teething. I just couldn't face the motorway again. Sat on the sofa with all three of them watching something stupid on the tablet and felt wrong the whole afternoon.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Vague about what specifically felt wrong — the lying, skipping the visit, or something else
"What exactly felt wrong — skipping, or the excuse?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
Both, but differently. The excuse was just cowardice. The skipping though — it's like I broke something. We've gone every Sunday since before the kids were born. Papa sets the table for all of us on Saturday night. When I called to cancel I could hear him putting the plates away in the background and it made me want to throw up. One missed week and I'm already thinking, what if it becomes easy to miss the next one?

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Clémence from the school pickup asked me why I bother driving out to my parents' every weekend when "nobody does that anymore." She said it like I was performing something. I told her it's just what we do, and she laughed and said her kids barely see their grandparents twice a year and everyone's fine. Good for her.

I don't know why it got under my skin so much. Maybe because part of me knows she has a point — the kids are exhausted by the time we get home, Hugo has football on Sunday mornings now and we keep pulling him out of it. My husband doesn't complain but I can feel his patience wearing thin when I insist we go even when it's pouring rain or one of them is sick.

But what's the alternative? We stop going and then what? My parents eat alone. My sister already moved to Bordeaux and barely calls. If I stop showing up, that table shrinks to two. I'm not going to be the one who lets that happen, even if Clémence thinks I'm being ridiculous about it.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona insists she won't stop going but also describes real costs to her own family — unresolved contradiction
"You're pulling Hugo out of football for this — does he get a say?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Called Maman tonight because Léa said something at dinner that nearly broke me. She said "Mamie's potatoes taste like your potatoes." She's five. She doesn't know what she's saying. But she connected it — the gratin, the way I do it with the nutmeg and the bay leaf exactly how Grand-mère taught Maman, how Maman taught me. Four generations of women and a potato dish and I'm crying over the phone like an idiot.

Maman laughed at me, which helped. She said Grand-mère would have said I was being dramatic, which is true. That woman didn't cry about anything. She just cooked and fed people and that was how she said everything she needed to say. I think I understand that now in a way I didn't when I was younger. The recipe box isn't just recipes. It's her entire way of being in the world, passed down in measurements and instructions.

I made Léa help me stir the béchamel tonight. She stood on the stool and held the wooden spoon with both hands. It was a small thing but it felt exactly right. Like I was doing what I'm supposed to be doing.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-17

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Sunday lunch went well this week. Papa made his cassoulet — the one he only does in winter because he says the beans need cold weather, which makes no sense but nobody argues. Hugo actually ate two bowls, which surprised everyone since he usually picks at things. My brother-in-law came without Sandrine, said she had a work thing in Bordeaux, and Maman pursed her lips but said nothing.

After lunch the kids played in the garden while the adults sat around the table with coffee. Papa told the story about his father's vineyard again — the one about the frost of '56 that killed everything and how they replanted by hand. Hugo was half-listening from the doorway. He's heard it before but I saw him lean in when Papa described his grandfather carrying the new vines on his back up the hill. These are the details that disappear if nobody passes them on.

Drove home in the dark. The baby slept the whole way. Hugo asked if we could come again next week and I said of course, that's what we do. It felt good to say it and mean it without any of the doubt from earlier this month.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Had coffee with my friend Nathalie this morning while the baby napped. She's going back to work full-time in March — her youngest starts maternelle — and she asked if I'd thought about it. I said not really, which is a lie. I think about it constantly. Before the children I worked at the préfecture, nothing exciting, but I was good at it. I had colleagues. I wore proper shoes.

But there's a voice in my head that sounds a lot like Maman, and Grand-mère before her, that says this is the work that matters. Being here when they come home. Cooking real food, not reheating things. Knowing their teachers' names, volunteering at the school. My mother did all of that and I never once came home to an empty house. I want that for my children too. But I also notice I've started counting the hours until bedtime some days, and that scares me.

Nathalie made it sound so simple — "You can do both." But can you? My mother didn't. Her mother didn't. And those families held together. I look at Clémence's kids eating canteen food five days a week and I think no, that's not what I want. But then I wonder if that's conviction or just fear of doing something different from what I know.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Persona questions whether her stance is conviction or fear but doesn't explore what specifically she's afraid of
"What would actually change at home if you worked?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Father Michel announced the parish is cancelling the Mardi Gras procession this year. Not enough volunteers, he said. My parents marched in it when they were children. I brought Hugo for the first time two years ago and he still talks about the paper lanterns.

I told Maman on the phone and she sighed and said "that's how it starts." She meant it starts with one thing cancelled, then another, then there's nothing left. I signed up to help organise it for next year, which means more time I don't have. But someone has to, or it just disappears.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona takes on more responsibility she admits she doesn't have time for, framing it as obligation rather than choice
"You said you're already counting hours — where does this time come from?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
From sleep, probably. Or from the one evening a week I watch something for myself after the kids are down. I know that's not sustainable. But if I don't volunteer, who does? The procession just dies. I'd rather be tired than explain to Hugo why the lanterns aren't happening anymore.
