- Bio: Marcus is a 29-year-old high school English teacher in Portland, Oregon, now in his fourth year at the same school—the longest he's stayed anywhere since college. Before teaching, he spent a year as a wilderness guide in Colorado, six months writing copy for a startup in Austin that folded, and a semester in a grad program for urban planning that he dropped. He picked up a teaching certificate through an alternative licensure program almost on a whim after a friend dared him to try substitute teaching. He's good at it—students like his off-script energy—but he's already feeling the walls of the curriculum calendar closing in.

## Entry 1 - 2025-08-17

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Back-to-school PD week and I'm already crawling out of my skin. Eight hours of slideshow presentations about "aligning to district benchmarks" and "fidelity to the pacing guide." Same slides as last year. I checked. They literally didn't update the copyright date.

I sat in the back row and started sketching out this idea I had for a unit where students write and perform original one-act plays instead of the standard five-paragraph essay unit. Pitched it to my department head during break. She said it sounded "fun but hard to assess against the rubric." Then she handed me the same binder of pre-made lesson plans they give every year. I wanted to throw it across the room.

The thing that gets me is I know I could light these kids up. Last spring when I threw out the textbook for a week and had them do a mock trial based on "To Kill a Mockingbird," the energy in that room was electric. Kids who never talked were arguing case law. But that was a one-off I snuck in. The system doesn't want that. The system wants the binder. I keep thinking about that wilderness guide job posting I saw last week. Flagstaff, Arizona. Six-month contract starting January. I have the tab still open.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (25-80 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

First week with students done. I'm wiped. Taught the same intro lesson five periods in a row. By fifth period I was on autopilot, hearing my own voice like it was someone else's. Came home, microwaved leftovers, fell asleep on the couch at 7:30. Don't have much else to say about it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (25-80 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Woke up at 11 PM still on the couch. Opened my phone and scrolled through photos from when I was guiding trips in the Rockies. Three years ago. Feels like a different person. Closed the app, stared at the ceiling. Didn't go back to sleep for a while. Something about this week got under my skin and I can't name it.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry hints at disconnect between past identity and current life — unnamed tension worth surfacing
"That different person — do you miss him?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Yeah. I do. He didn't have a retirement account or a lease or a faculty parking spot, but he woke up not knowing what the day would look like, and that felt right. Now I know exactly what every Tuesday looks like through June. I traded the unknown for the predictable, and most days I tell myself that was growing up. Tonight I'm not sure it was.

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-28

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Had a genuinely good day, which is worth writing down because those have been rare lately. I threw out my fourth-period lesson plan halfway through class. The kids were dead-eyed reading the textbook excerpt, so I told them to close their books and we spent the rest of the period doing a walking debate around the room about whether Gatsby deserved sympathy. They had to physically move to a corner based on their position and defend it out loud.

It was messy and loud and two kids got into a real argument that I had to mediate, but every single person in that room was thinking. That's the version of this job I signed up for. Not the binder. Not the pacing guide. The moment when something catches fire and you're just there holding space for it.

Afterwards one of my quieter students, Kai, stayed behind and said it was the first time he didn't watch the clock all period. That landed. I drove home with the windows down and music loud and felt something I haven't felt at work in months — like I was in the right place. I know tomorrow I'll be back to the binder for the observation cycle. But today reminded me there's a version of this that works for me. I just have to keep finding cracks to push through.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry shows genuine satisfaction but frames it as exception — worth exploring what that pattern means
"What keeps you from teaching like that every day?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Observations, rubrics, pacing calendars, standardized test prep schedules, a department head who measures success by data walls. The infrastructure isn't built for what happened today. I'd have to fight for it constantly, and honestly I don't know if I have the stamina to fight a system every single day just to do my job the way I think it should be done. Some days the path of least resistance is just opening the binder.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Labor Day weekend and everyone went camping up near Hood River. I almost didn't go — had a stack of essays to grade — but forced myself. It was fine. Good, even. River was cold and perfect, did some bouldering, someone brought a guitar.

But sitting around the fire Saturday night I realized half the group was talking about their plans: houses they're buying, weddings they're planning, promotions. And I'm sitting there thinking about a six-month wilderness guide contract in Arizona and whether I could break my lease. I didn't say it out loud. I just laughed along and poked the fire.

I don't know when my friends became people with five-year plans. Or when I became the one who still doesn't have one. It's not that I think they're wrong. It's that the idea of mapping out the next five years makes me feel like I can't breathe.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-05

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Met with the vice principal today about leading the new "innovation lab" elective they want to pilot next semester. It would be a project-based class, student-directed, no textbook, no standardized test alignment. Basically everything I've been wanting. She said she thought of me because of the feedback from students about my off-script moments.

I should be thrilled. Part of me is. But the catch is it's one period out of five, and taking it on means extra planning hours and serving on the curriculum committee, which meets every other Wednesday through May. More meetings. More structure layered on top of the thing that's supposed to be the antidote to structure.

I told her I'd think about it over the weekend. Walking to my car I was already arguing with myself. One voice saying this is exactly the kind of opening I've been asking for, stop being impossible to satisfy. Another voice saying one elective doesn't change the other four periods of binder teaching, and now I'd be even more locked in with committee obligations.

Called my sister on the drive home. She said "Marcus, you'd complain about winning the lottery." She's not entirely wrong. But I also don't think wanting more than one period of real teaching out of five is unreasonable. I just don't know if the answer is to take the deal or to admit this whole career might not be the right container.
