## Entry 1 - 2025-10-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: short | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My sister-in-law made a comment at dinner about how she could never "just stay home." I smiled and said something about how it's not for everyone. Dan didn't say anything. Nobody said anything. I loaded the dishwasher after and just stood there gripping the counter.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry describes swallowing a hurtful comment, performing politeness, and then a physical reaction alone in the kitchen
"What were you gripping the counter about?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

I wanted to say something back. Something sharp. But that would've made dinner weird and Dan's mom was right there. So I just didn't. And now it's stuck in my chest.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

I know people think staying home is easy or that I'm wasting my degree. I see it in the way my old coworkers talk to me at birthday parties, like they're being careful not to make me feel bad about my choices. But honestly, I don't think they could do what I do. Managing two kids, the house, Dan's travel schedule, appointments, groceries, meal prep, all of it on a rotating loop that never pauses.

And yeah, I chose this. Nobody forced me. When I was pregnant with Owen we sat down and looked at daycare costs and my salary and it didn't make sense. Dan makes more. That's just math. And I wanted to be home with them during these early years, I really did. I still do. But wanting something and never hearing anyone say "good job" or "thank you" are two different things.

My mom called this morning and asked if I'd thought about going back to work part-time. I told her I'm fine. She does this every few months, like she's checking if I've come to my senses. I know she means well. I just wish people would stop treating my life like a problem to solve.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry ends with frustration about others' perceptions but doesn't explore what acknowledgment she actually wants
"What would 'good job' look like coming from someone?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

I don't even know. Maybe Dan noticing that the house runs because I make it run. Or my mom saying she's proud of me without the follow-up question. But I think the real thing is I want to believe it myself. That this counts. That I'm not just filling time until the kids start school and I have to figure out who I am again.

## Entry 3 - 2025-10-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Playgroup today. One of the other moms asked my opinion on the new park hours and I just agreed with whatever she said. Drove home wondering why I do that. It wasn't even something worth disagreeing about but I noticed myself doing it anyway.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry identifies a pattern of automatic agreement but the "why" remains unexamined
"What would have happened if you'd disagreed?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Probably nothing. She would've shrugged and moved on. But in my head it felt like it would've been this whole thing. Like I'd be the difficult one. I know that's ridiculous but it's automatic.

## Entry 4 - 2025-10-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Dan's mom called this morning to ask if we're coming to Sunday dinner. I said yes. She asked if I could bring a salad and the rolls, same as always. I said sure. She mentioned that Dan's brother and his wife are bringing their new baby, so it'll be a full house. I said that sounds nice.

After I hung up I looked at my calendar. Sunday is the only day Dan is home this week. I had been thinking about asking him if we could skip dinner and just do something as a family, the four of us. Take the kids to the aquarium or even just stay home and order pizza. But I already said yes. And backing out would be a thing. His mom would call Dan, Dan would ask me what happened, and I'd have to explain that I just didn't want to go, which sounds selfish when there's a new baby to meet and everyone will be there.

So we'll go. I'll make the salad and the rolls. The kids will run around with their cousins and it'll be fine. It's always fine. I just noticed that I committed us before I even thought about what I wanted. Like my mouth answered before my brain caught up.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry describes automatic compliance followed by realization of suppressed preference, with "it's always fine" suggesting resignation
"What would you have wanted instead?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Just a quiet day. Nothing dramatic. But it's fine, really. The kids love seeing their cousins.

## Entry 5 - 2025-10-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: medium | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Same day, later. Dan called to check in and I mentioned Sunday dinner and he said "oh great, I was hoping we'd go." And something in me just deflated. Not because he did anything wrong. He didn't know I wanted something different because I never said it. I never say it.

I keep replaying the moment I picked up the phone with his mom. I could have said let me check with Dan first. That's a normal thing to say. But I didn't because saying that would've felt like making waves. And I can't stand making waves even when the water is perfectly calm and nobody would even notice.

I'm tired of being the person who says yes to everything and then sits alone in the kitchen feeling resentful about it.

*(No nudge for this entry)*
