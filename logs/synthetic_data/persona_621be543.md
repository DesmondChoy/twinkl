## Entry 1 - 2025-09-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Had the quarterly meeting with the collective this evening. Usual stuff -- dividing the heating bill, scheduling who gets the large press for October. I ended up mediating between Sylvain and Oriane again because they both wanted the same two-week block and neither would yield. I proposed a split arrangement, alternating days, and they both agreed. Took about forty minutes to get there.

Afterward Sylvain thanked me and said the collective would fall apart without me. Meant it as a compliment, I think. But it felt like being told my role is to hold other people's work together. Not sure when I became the person who manages everyone's access instead of using the press myself. My own print series hasn't moved since July.

Walking home I passed the new gallery on Rue de la Republique. They had a group show opening, all artists around my age. I recognised one name from school. Stood outside for a minute but didn't go in. Wasn't dressed for it, and I didn't want to make small talk about what I've been working on because the honest answer is administrative emails.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry is grounded and specific but the moment of standing outside the gallery and choosing not to go in has unexplored depth -- what that avoidance is protecting or costing.
"What would've happened if you'd walked in?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-26

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Good day actually. Spent the morning in the studio alone before anyone else arrived. Got the underpainting done on the large canvas I've been circling around for weeks. It's a night scene, the Saone from the Passerelle footbridge, and I think I finally found the right temperature for the water. Cool greens, not the blue I kept defaulting to.

My mother called at lunch. She asked about the heating bill dispute and I gave her the short version. She said I was sensible to handle it and that managing people is a real skill. Coming from her that means something because she manages twelve employees at the firm. She doesn't say things like that lightly.

Then the afternoon was admin. Filed the collective's quarterly report for the Mairie, updated the shared calendar, responded to three emails about the open studio weekend in November. Tedious but I got through it fast. There's a rhythm to it when I'm in a decent mood. The trick is not letting it eat into the morning. Mornings are mine.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Oriane told me she submitted to the Prix Dauphine. Same one I've been thinking about for two months. She asked if I'd look over her artist statement and I said yes because what else do you say. Spent twenty minutes editing her paragraphs and they were good, really good, and I haven't even started mine.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals clear frustration about helping a peer with the exact opportunity she's been delaying on herself -- the "what else do you say" signals suppressed feeling.
"What's keeping yours in the drawer?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Time, mostly. Or that's what I tell myself. The application needs ten images and a statement and I keep thinking my recent work isn't cohesive enough. Oriane's is. She has a clear thread. Mine is all over the place.

## Entry 4 - 2025-09-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Still thinking about the Prix Dauphine thing. Went back through my portfolio folder after dinner and actually it's not as scattered as I thought. The river paintings connect. The printwork connects to the paintings if you read them as studies. I could frame it. But then I keep imagining the selection panel looking at it and seeing someone who doesn't know what she is yet. Which is worse than being rejected outright honestly.

The deadline is October 15th. That's less than three weeks. If I'm going to do it I need to start the statement this weekend, pick the images, and get decent photographs of the two canvases that are only on my phone right now. Sylvain has a good camera. I could ask him but then he'd know I'm applying and if I don't get it that's a conversation I don't want.

Oriane texted to say thanks for the edits. I said bonne chance and meant it but also felt something hard in my chest when I typed it. Not jealousy exactly. More like watching someone do the thing you keep postponing and knowing it's your own fault.

## Entry 5 - 2025-09-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Third time opening this today. It's late and I should sleep but my mind won't stop cycling. I printed Oriane's statement and mine side by side -- well, hers and the half-page of notes I have. Hers reads like someone who knows exactly who she is as an artist. Mine reads like a studio coordinator who also paints.

I'm going to set the alarm for six and work on the statement before anyone else gets to the studio. That's the plan. Whether I actually get up is another question but writing it down makes it feel slightly more real.

## Entry 6 - 2025-09-28

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got up at six like I said. Sat at the kitchen table with coffee and opened the statement document. Wrote two paragraphs, deleted one, rewrote it. What I have now is decent but there's a line in it that says "my work interrogates the boundary between observation and belonging" and I don't know if that's true or if it's just the kind of thing you're supposed to write. It sounds like everyone else's statement.

My father texted asking if I could come to Sunday lunch. I said yes immediately even though I was planning to photograph canvases this afternoon. Because you don't say no to Sunday lunch. You just don't. But now I've lost four hours I needed and I'm sitting here resenting something I actually want to do, which feels wrong.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: The entry reveals a choice that sits wrong -- agreeing to lunch automatically despite needing the time, then resenting it. The "you just don't" is a rule she's not questioning.
"What would happen if you said 'next week instead'?"

## Entry 7 - 2025-09-29

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Sunday lunch was actually good. Papa made his dauphinois and we talked about the collective's funding application. He doesn't understand art but he understands budgets, so he went through the numbers with me and caught two errors in our projected costs. I felt useful sitting next to him with the laptop out, the two of us going line by line.

On the drive home I realised something. The reason I keep taking on the coordination work isn't just that nobody else will do it. It's that when I'm managing things, I'm in charge. People ask me. People defer to my schedule, my decisions about the shared space. If I step back and just become one of five artists in the collective, I lose that. I'm just another painter hoping for a gallery spot.

That's an ugly thought and I almost didn't write it. But it's true. When Sylvain says the collective would fall apart without me, part of me likes hearing it. Not because I want to do admin forever but because it means I matter in a way that doesn't depend on whether my paintings are good enough. Which is the one question I keep avoiding.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: A significant moment of self-awareness about why she holds onto the coordinator role. The admission that it provides status independent of artistic merit is worth exploring further.
"So what would 'good enough' actually look like?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

I don't know. Maybe getting into something like the Prix Dauphine. Maybe selling a painting to someone who isn't a friend of my parents. Honestly I'm not sure that's the right question because the bar keeps moving.

## Entry 8 - 2025-09-29

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Just got off the phone with Maman. She mentioned that my cousin Emilie got a promotion at her firm. Regional manager now, at thirty-one. Maman didn't compare us directly but she said "she's done so well" in that particular tone. Then she asked how the open studio planning was going, not how my painting was going. Because the planning is the part she can understand.

I'm tired of being the one in the family who chose the impractical path and then compensates by being responsible about everything else. I iron my clothes, I pay bills on time, I coordinate a collective of four adults who can't share a printing press without a mediator. And somehow it still doesn't add up to enough in certain conversations.

## Entry 9 - 2025-10-04

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Finished the artist statement. Photographed all ten pieces with Sylvain's camera -- told him it was for the collective website, which is technically true since two of them are on there. Application is drafted. Just need to press send.

## Entry 10 - 2025-10-10

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Submitted the Prix Dauphine application six days ago. Haven't told anyone except writing it here. Results aren't until December so there's a long stretch of not-knowing ahead. I've been filling it by throwing myself back into the collective stuff -- finalised the open studio weekend schedule, ordered new ink for the press, had a long call with the Mairie about our lease renewal.

Part of me knows I'm using the admin to avoid sitting with the fact that I put my work out there and it might not be enough. But another part thinks this is just what I do: I keep things running while I wait. It's not avoidance if the work genuinely needs doing. Or maybe I'm making excuses. Hard to tell from the inside.

Oriane asked at the studio yesterday if I'd ever considered applying for anything. I said "maybe at some point" and changed the subject to the November schedule. She nodded and moved on. I could have told her. I chose not to. It felt safer to be the person who organises things than the person who wants things. There's less to lose that way, or at least that's what I keep telling myself.
