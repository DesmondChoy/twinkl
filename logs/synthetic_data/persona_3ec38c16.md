## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent the whole afternoon with Abu Mahmoud at his farm outside Karameh. Three hours sitting on plastic chairs drinking tea while he showed me where the irrigation canal used to run before the allocation changed. His hands, the way he traced the old waterline in the dirt like drawing a map from memory. Forty years he worked that land. Now his grandson is driving trucks in Amman because there is nothing left to grow.

I recorded everything but the recording will not capture how quiet he got when I asked about the cooperative's petition. How he looked past me toward the orchards, half of them dried stumps now. Dr. Khalil wants regression models and policy impact matrices. What I have is Abu Mahmoud saying "we wrote letters until we ran out of paper." This is what I came here for. Not the degree, not the credentials. This.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: "This is what I came here for" - unexplored motivation worth pulling
"What made you leave engineering for this?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

Thirty years I designed systems to move water from where it was to where it was needed. Good work. Useful work. But always I was working for someone else's priorities, someone else's calculations about who matters. The last project, we diverted a whole tributary for a development that displaced six villages. I signed my name to those drawings. Came home and could not sleep for a week. Told my husband I needed to understand the other side of my own blueprints.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Committee meeting today. Dr. Khalil brought up timeline again, asked when I would have my methodology chapter finalized. I told him the fieldwork is taking longer because I am doing it properly, not rushing through interviews like they are survey forms. He gave me that look, the one he gives when he thinks I am being difficult. Said something about how at my stage of career I should know how to work within constraints.

At my stage. Meaning old. Meaning I should be grateful they let me in at all, should play by the rules without questioning. He does not say this directly but I hear it. The younger students in my cohort, they nod along, they revise when told to revise. Maybe that is smarter. Maybe I am wasting everyone's time insisting my approach matters. But every time I sit down to write the chapter his way, my hands just stop. Something in me refuses.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Hedging language ("Maybe that is smarter", "Maybe I am wasting everyone's time") hints at unresolved conflict
"What specifically about his way makes your hands stop?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

He wants me to treat the farmers as data points. Sample size, response rates, coding categories. I understand the logic, I am not stupid about methodology. But when I sit down to write it that way, I keep seeing Abu Mahmoud's face. He trusted me with his story. Reducing it to a variable in a regression feels like betraying that trust. Like I am doing the same thing I did as an engineer, just with different paperwork.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Roommates had people over until 2am again. Studied at the library until they kicked me out, then sat in my car in the parking lot reading by phone light. Called Farshad and he laughed, said I am the most stubborn person he knows.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry too brief, no concrete details about what she was studying or her emotional state
"What were you reading in the car?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Papers on participatory action research. Found this scholar from Brazil who worked with fishing communities fighting industrial pollution. Her whole methodology is about the community being partners in the research, not subjects. Reading her citations like following a trail. If Dr. Khalil will not accept my approach, maybe I can build enough of a foundation that he cannot dismiss it as naive.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-17

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Presented the participatory framework to the committee today. Dr. Khalil called it unconventional. Dr. Haddad said she found it compelling. Got approval to continue with modifications. Walked out of that room feeling like I had earned something that was mine.

*(No nudge for this entry)*
