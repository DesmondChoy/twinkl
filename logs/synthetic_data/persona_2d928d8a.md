## Entry 1 - 2025-02-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Spent the last two hours staring at a term sheet from a Lisbon-based startup that wants us to come in as operational partners. The numbers are solid enough but what actually caught me was the founder, this woman who walked away from a consulting gig to build a port logistics platform from scratch. She reminded me of how I felt fifteen years ago when I signed my first warehouse lease with money I did not really have.

The thing is, I told Ingrid I would slow down this year. We said that after the second exit. That was supposed to be the point where we had enough runway to just breathe for a while. And we do have the runway. But I keep circling back to this Lisbon deal like a dog that will not leave a bone alone.

I know what the smart move is. Park the capital, let the reserves do their work, stay disciplined. But I feel this pull and I cannot explain it rationally. It is not about the money. It is something about the feeling of standing at the edge of something that does not have a guaranteed outcome.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Describes a strong pull toward the deal but stops short of examining what specifically about "standing at the edge" appeals to him versus the breathing room he promised.
"What does that edge feel like compared to the breathing room you mentioned?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-02-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Call with the Lisbon founder again today, third one this week. She pitched the expansion roadmap and honestly it is ambitious but not reckless. I ran the downside scenarios on a napkin while she was talking, which is a habit Ingrid would recognize and roll her eyes at. Worst case we lose about what I spent on that sailboat restoration three years ago, so it is recoverable.

Ingrid asked over dinner if I had decided. I said not yet. That is technically true but I think she could tell from my tone that I have already half-committed in my head. She did not push back, just said "make sure you are not chasing the feeling again." I told her I did not know what she meant, which was a lie.

## Entry 3 - 2025-02-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Valentine's dinner last night, the Italian place near Erasmusbrug. We had a good time, actually managed to not talk about business for most of it. Ingrid brought up taking a trip to Gotland this summer to visit her mother, maybe staying a few weeks. I said yes immediately, genuinely meant it.

But then on the walk home I caught myself thinking about the Lisbon timeline and whether a few weeks in Sweden would slow down onboarding if we signed the deal. I did not say that out loud. I wonder when I started splitting like this, one half of me wanting to just be present and the other half always running the next scenario.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Mentions "splitting" between being present and running scenarios but does not clarify what being present actually looks like for him or why it feels difficult.
"When you say splitting, which half feels more like you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

That is the problem, they both do. The planning half is not some unwanted intruder, it is the part that built everything we have. But the part that wanted to just walk along the water with Ingrid without calculating anything, that felt real too. I think they used to be the same thing but somewhere along the way they started pulling in different directions.

## Entry 4 - 2025-02-15

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Saturday morning, sitting with coffee in the kitchen. The house is quiet. Ingrid went to the market early which means she is buying too much cheese again and I will pretend to be surprised when she gets back.

I made a decision last night. I am going to pass on the Lisbon deal. Not because the numbers are wrong or because the founder is not impressive but because I realized I was looking for a feeling, not a business case. The feeling of the leap. That rush of committing to something uncertain and then having to make it work. I know that feeling well and it has served me, but I do not think chasing it right now is the responsible move.

We have the reserves in a good place. The studio has three portfolio companies that need attention. Ingrid and I are in a solid rhythm. I do not need to blow that up to feel alive. At least that is what I am telling myself this morning. Ask me again next week when I am bored.

## Entry 5 - 2025-02-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

One of our portfolio companies, the cold storage outfit in Antwerp, just lost their anchor client. Found out this morning from a panicked call from the founder who I could barely understand because he was speaking so fast. This is the company where we parked the biggest chunk of operational capital.

I spent the entire day on calls, restructuring scenarios, talking to our lawyer about contract terms. By evening I had a workable plan but the whole time there was this tight feeling in my chest. Not about the money exactly, we can absorb the hit if we need to. It is more that I had just gotten comfortable with the idea of things being stable and now the ground shifted.

What irritates me is that I know this is part of the game. I have been through worse. The first company almost went under twice before we found our footing. But back then the instability felt like fuel. Now it just feels like a threat to something I have built up carefully. I do not know when that switch happened.

## Entry 6 - 2025-02-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Antwerp situation is stabilizing. We found a replacement client, not as big but enough to keep the operation running while we diversify the pipeline. I spent three days in Antwerp this week working on-site with the team and it reminded me that I actually enjoy the problem-solving part of this work more than the deal-making part.

There is something specific about walking into a warehouse that is half-empty and figuring out how to fill it. Not the adrenaline of a new deal but the satisfaction of fixing what is broken. Maybe that is the version of this work that does not require me to keep jumping off cliffs.

Had a long phone call with Ingrid tonight and told her about the replacement client. She sounded relieved, which I noticed because she had been careful not to sound worried all week. She said she is glad I was there in person rather than just sending emails. She is right. The founder needed to see someone calm in the room. I think I needed to be that person for my own reasons too.

## Entry 7 - 2025-03-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got an email from the Lisbon founder today. She closed the round without us, brought in a Madrid-based firm instead. Good for her. But I would be lying if I said it did not sting. Not because we lost the deal, I walked away from it deliberately. It stings because reading her update about the progress they have made in the last three weeks made me feel like I am standing still.

I know that is irrational. The studio is doing fine, the Antwerp crisis proved the model works, we are in good shape. But "good shape" feels like treading water sometimes. Like I am maintaining rather than building. And maintaining is not something I have ever been good at sitting with.

Ingrid would say this is exactly the pattern she warned me about. I get things to a good place, feel restless, then go looking for the next thing to keep myself occupied. She is probably right. But knowing it is a pattern does not make the restlessness go away. I keep checking the inbox for something that will make tomorrow feel different from today.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Acknowledges the pattern of restlessness and recognizes his wife is right, but then says knowing it is a pattern does not help. Tension between wanting to feel content with stability and needing forward momentum.
"You said maintaining is not something you sit with. But you also chose it. What changed?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting

Nothing changed. I just had a slow day and read an email at the wrong time. It is fine. The Antwerp thing took a lot out of me and I probably just need a proper weekend off. Ingrid suggested we drive out to Kinderdijk, maybe I will take her up on that.

## Entry 8 - 2025-03-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Did the Kinderdijk trip. Walked for hours, barely talked, ate pannenkoeken at that place near the windmills. It was exactly what I needed and I managed to leave my phone in the car for most of it.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Very brief entry after a period of restlessness; the phone detail suggests intentional disconnection worth exploring.
"What was it like having the phone in the car?"

## Entry 9 - 2025-03-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Portfolio review meeting today with all three founders. The numbers are where they should be, maybe slightly ahead. The cold storage team in Antwerp has a real pipeline now and the other two are humming along. I should feel good about this and I suppose I do, in the way you feel good about a clean audit.

A guy I used to work with in Stockholm called afterward, wants to pitch me on a drone delivery concept for Nordic rural areas. My first instinct was interest. My second instinct was to check whether the first instinct was the problem. I told him to send the deck and I would look at it. Not committing to anything, just looking.

## Entry 10 - 2025-03-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Stayed up too late reading the drone deck. It is actually well put together. The unit economics make sense for the regions they are targeting and the regulatory window is real. I caught myself building a financial model in a spreadsheet at one in the morning, which is exactly the kind of thing I do when something grabs me.

But I closed the laptop and went to bed. Ingrid was already asleep. I lay there thinking about the Antwerp scare and how it felt to have something we built nearly fall apart. I do not want to stretch us thin again. The reserves are there for a reason. Tomorrow I will look at the deck with fresh eyes and probably find three deal-breakers I missed because I was running on adrenaline.

## Entry 11 - 2025-03-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Looked at the drone deck again over lunch. Found one real concern around the supply chain for replacement parts but the other issues I expected to find were not there. The founder has thought through most of the obvious failure modes.

Told Ingrid about it. She asked how much capital it would need and I gave her the number. She went quiet for a while and then said it was my call but that she wanted me to think about why the last time I felt this way about a deal I chose to walk away. I do not have a good answer for why this time feels different. Maybe it does not feel different. Maybe I am just further from the last scare.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Ingrid's pointed question about the Lisbon deal mirrors the recurring pattern; the persona admits he may simply have less recent fear rather than a new rationale.
"Is the distance from the scare the reason, or the excuse?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Probably the excuse. I know that. Three weeks ago I was rattled by Antwerp and swore I would not overextend. Now I am sitting here telling myself this one is different because the deck looks solid. But every deck looks solid when you want it to. The honest answer is I miss the feeling of building something from nothing and I am trying to dress that up as a business decision.

## Entry 12 - 2025-03-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Called my Stockholm friend back and told him I need two weeks to think. He said fine. I keep going back and forth and I hate that I cannot just pick a lane and stay in it.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Very compressed entry expressing frustration at indecision; the "pick a lane" phrase suggests an unexamined assumption that the two sides are irreconcilable.
"What if both lanes are yours?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Then I would need to figure out a speed that works for both of them. Ingrid said something like that once, that maybe the problem is not what I want but how much of it I want at once. I did not really hear it at the time but it is starting to make sense. Maybe there is a version of this where I do not have to choose between building and protecting, I just have to stop pretending one of them is the whole answer.
