## Entry 1 - 2025-04-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Okay so today was a lot and I'm still processing everything honestly. Got to the welcome center this morning and there was this family from Syria, father and two kids, and the little girl was maybe six years old and she had this tiny sketchbook she'd been carrying since they left Damascus. She showed me her drawings. Houses on fire. People running. A boat with stick figures packed so tight they looked like a fence. And then the last page was just colors—blue and orange and yellow—and she said that was what she wanted to see now. I nearly lost it right there but you can't do that in front of them so I just smiled and said her colors were beautiful.

Then I had to go straight from there to meet Pieter about the factory wall commission and he was talking about branding and "visual impact metrics" and I just sat there thinking about that little girl's sketchbook and how my murals are supposed to mean something but here I am discussing color palettes that will make people want to buy sustainable sneakers. Like what am I even doing? The sneakers are made ethically apparently, fair wages, recycled materials, so it's not like I'm selling my soul to Shell or whatever, but still. The whole meeting felt hollow.

Walked around the harbor for an hour after instead of taking the tram home. The water was that grey-green it gets in April and I kept thinking about the fishing boats in Lisbon and Maria who helped me there and how she said art that changes nothing is just decoration. Am I just decorating? The mural will be seen by thousands of people every day. Maybe one person thinks differently about what they consume. Maybe nobody does and it just looks cool and gets likes.

I don't know. I'm tired and I smell like spray paint and I can't stop seeing that little girl's drawings. Tomorrow I have to give Pieter an answer about the commission. I should probably say yes because I need the money but something in my chest is tight about it.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Clear tension between need for income and artistic integrity, hedging with "probably should" and unresolved physical discomfort ("something in my chest is tight")
"What would Maria say about the sneaker thing?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Ha. She'd probably tell me I'm overthinking it and that any wall is better than no wall. But then she'd also ask me what story I want to tell on it, and right now I don't have a story. I just have a brand deck with hex codes and a brief that says "inspire conscious consumption." Maybe that's the problem—it's their story, not mine.

**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

I said no to Pieter. Told him yesterday and he was actually pretty understanding about it, said he'd keep me in mind for future projects, but I could tell he was disappointed. Whatever. I can't be responsible for everyone's disappointment.

What I didn't expect was how RELIEVED I felt after. Like I'd been holding my breath for a week and finally exhaled. Spent all of today at the welcome center instead of in my studio and it was exactly where I needed to be. We did an art session with some of the kids—just paper and crayons, nothing fancy—and I sat with Amira (the Syrian girl from before) and we drew together for two hours. She's so quiet but her hands never stop moving across the paper. She drew her grandmother today. A woman in a blue dress standing in a kitchen with yellow walls. She told me her grandmother makes the best knafeh but she doesn't know if she's still alive because they haven't been able to reach her since January.

I don't know how to hold that. I don't know what to do with the fact that I worried for a week about a sneaker mural while this kid doesn't know if her grandmother is alive. It makes everything I do feel small and pointless but also somehow more urgent? Like if I'm going to make things then they have to MATTER. They have to reach people the way Amira's drawings reach me.

I talked to Bram on the phone tonight—he's still in Berlin, been there four months now doing projections on the Reichstag for some climate group—and he said something that stuck with me. He said we can't measure ourselves by the size of the problem. That if everyone waited until they could fix everything, nothing would ever get made. I know he's right but it doesn't make the gap between what I want to do and what I can actually do feel any smaller.

Anyway. I'm going to start something new. Not sure what yet. Maybe something with the kids at the center, collaborative, their images mixed with mine. Something that tells THEIR story instead of a brand's story. No money in it probably but at this point I think I'd rather be broke and making something real than comfortable and decorating.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions potential collaborative project with refugee kids but doesn't explore what that might look like or how she'd approach it—a dangling thread worth pulling
"What would the kids' piece look like?"

I've been thinking about it all night actually. What if it wasn't a mural at all? What if it was something that moved? The boats in Lisbon worked because they existed in water, in motion—people saw them differently depending on the tide, the light. Amira's drawings are so full of movement even on flat paper. Houses falling, people running, boats tipping. What if we made something together that could actually move? Projections maybe, like what Bram does, but with their drawings animated somehow. I don't know how to do that technically but Bram might.

The more I think about it the more I realize the static murals were starting to feel like cages. I'd finish one and immediately want to be somewhere else, doing something else. Maybe that restlessness was telling me something—not just that I need to travel or whatever, but that the medium itself wasn't right anymore. I want to make things that breathe. That change. Things people can't just walk past and forget.
