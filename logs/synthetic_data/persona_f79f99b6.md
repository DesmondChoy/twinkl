## Entry 1 - 2025-06-29

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Look, the pivot makes sense. Everyone at the Thursday pitch night kept asking why we dropped the furniture line when we had traction, but traction is not the same thing as momentum. We had retailers interested, sure, but the margins were getting squeezed and the whole supply chain was becoming a nightmare with shipping costs out of Shenzhen. I am not going to sit there manufacturing the same shelving unit for the next ten years just because some shops in Eindhoven like them.

Pieter thinks I pulled the trigger too fast. He said that in the meeting, in front of Anouk and Daan, which I did not appreciate. He has been with me since the Philips days and sometimes he acts like that gives him permission to question every call I make publicly. Maybe it does. I do not know. But I also know that if I had listened to the cautious voices three years ago we would still be making Bluetooth speakers nobody asked for.

The urban farming kits — there is something there. I can feel it in the conversations I am having. The market is shifting, people want to grow things, they want control over food, they want something tangible. We just need six months to prove the concept. That is not reckless. That is reading the room.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry repeatedly justifies a decision while acknowledging others disagree
"What bothered you most about Pieter saying it?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

That he might be right. Not about the pivot being wrong, but about me not giving things enough time. I have heard it before from other people. It is a pattern I do not love seeing pointed out.

## Entry 2 - 2025-07-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Two days of back-to-back calls with potential suppliers in Portugal and a prototype manufacturer in Ghent. My voice is shot. Ate a cheese sandwich at my desk around three and that was it until I got home and microwaved leftover stamppot that tasted like nothing.

The boys called. Sven wants to go to a music festival in Belgium and needs money. Matteo got a B+ on his physics exam and sounded genuinely proud, which made me proud too, even though I had nothing to do with it. Katrien is the one who sat with him while he studied. I was in Lisbon looking at terracotta planters.

I told Sven I would think about the festival money. What I actually thought was: I cannot keep saying yes to everything just because I feel guilty for not being there. But I will probably say yes anyway because that is what I do — throw money at the gap where my presence should be.

The Ghent manufacturer can do small runs. That is good. Keeps us lean. I should be more excited about that than I am right now. I think I am just tired.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals guilt about parenting absence alongside exhaustion from work
"What would being there actually look like?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

I do not know. Sitting in their kitchen helping with homework? Driving Sven to football practice? It sounds so ordinary but I have built my whole life to avoid ordinary, and now ordinary is the thing I cannot reach.

## Entry 3 - 2025-07-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Woke up at four again, brain already running. Kept thinking about whether the modular design should be stackable or side-by-side. Side-by-side takes more floor space but stackable has structural issues — the weight of wet soil plus the grow lights, it is not trivial. Sketched something on the back of an envelope before I even brushed my teeth.

Then my mind jumped to the lease. Studio lease is up in September. Pieter wants to renew for two years. Two years feels like a prison sentence. What if we need to move closer to a port? What if we need less space? What if we need more? I said let us do one year with an option to extend. He gave me that look. The one that says here we go again.

Had coffee with an old colleague from Philips, Joost. He is still there. Same building, same floor, different title. He seemed content but when I described what I was doing his eyes got wide and he said he could never do that. I used to find that flattering. Today it just made me feel alone.

Then back to the planters. Emailed three more suppliers. One in Valencia looks promising. Set up a video call for Friday. Kept going until my neck hurt and I realized it was already dark and I had not eaten. Ordered Thai food and ate it standing in the kitchen scrolling through competitor listings.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry jumps between many threads without settling on any
"Which of those things is actually keeping you up at night?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

The lease. Not because of the space, but because signing anything for a fixed term makes my chest tight. I know that is not rational. It is just how I am wired.

## Entry 4 - 2025-07-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Katrien called. Not the boys, Katrien herself. She never does that unless something is wrong or she needs to tell me something I will not like.

Matteo has been acting out at school. Skipping classes, talking back to teachers. She thinks it started around the time I cancelled the last weekend because of the Lisbon trip. She did not say it is my fault, but she did not have to. The silence after she described what happened was louder than anything she could have said.

I sat in my car for twenty minutes after that call. Just sat there in the parking garage under the studio, engine off, staring at the concrete wall. I wanted to call Matteo but what would I say? Sorry I was looking at planters in Portugal instead of watching your football match? Sorry I keep choosing the next interesting thing over the predictable thing that happens to include you?

He is fourteen. He does not understand that I am trying to build something. Or maybe he understands perfectly and just does not think it is a good enough reason. Maybe he is right.

I am going to Utrecht this weekend. No excuses. I already told Pieter to handle the Friday call with Valencia.

## Entry 5 - 2025-07-06

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: medium | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Weekend in Utrecht was hard. Matteo barely looked at me. Sven was fine, acted like nothing was wrong, which somehow felt worse. We went to get frites and walked along the canal and I kept trying to say something meaningful but everything came out flat.

On Sunday I took them to a climbing wall. Matteo actually engaged for the first time. Something about the challenge of it, figuring out the next hold, the height. He was grinning at the top. For about an hour he forgot he was angry with me.

Drove home and cried in the car. Not the dramatic kind, just the quiet leaking kind where you keep driving and wiping your face.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry describes a rare emotional release followed by the phrase "quiet leaking kind" that minimizes it
"Why do you think the climbing wall worked?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

Because it was not sitting across a table pretending everything is normal. It was doing something together that required focus and a bit of nerve. Maybe that is the only language I know how to speak. Maybe Matteo is the same way and I never noticed.

## Entry 6 - 2025-07-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

A whole week gone and I cannot tell you what I accomplished. Meetings, emails, a prototype review that raised more questions than it answered. The Valencia supplier fell through — their minimum order is ten times what we need. Back to square one on that front.

Pieter brought up the furniture line again. Casually, over lunch, like he was just thinking out loud. "We still have the moulds," he said. "The retailers would take us back." I did not respond. Just kept eating my soup.

I spent the evening reading about vertical farming startups in Copenhagen and Stockholm. Some of them are doing incredible things. Modular, scalable, beautiful design. Part of me got fired up. Part of me thought: they are already there. You are late. You are always starting things and by the time you get somewhere, someone else has already built it better.

Anouk sent me a link to a design competition in Milan. Entry deadline is August. I opened the page, looked at the brief, felt that old kick of energy. Then I closed the tab because I know what happens — I spend three weeks on it, neglect the actual business, and end up with a beautiful submission and no revenue.

I do not know what I am doing. I mean I know what I am doing day to day. I just do not know what it adds up to.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry ends with existential doubt about cumulative purpose
"What would it need to add up to?"

*(No response - persona did not reply to nudge)*

## Entry 7 - 2025-07-15

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: short | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Took a walk along the Maas after work. Watched the barges pass. Realized I have been in fight mode for weeks and forgot to just look at things. The water helped.

## Entry 8 - 2025-07-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: long | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Pieter handed in his notice today. Twenty minutes before our morning standup, just walked into my office and put a printed letter on my desk. After eight years. Eight years of me dragging him through pivots and late nights and "trust me on this one."

He said he has taken a position at a consultancy in Amsterdam. Better pay, predictable hours, no more wondering whether the next quarter will exist. He was calm about it. Almost gentle. Said it was not personal, that he just needs stability, that he has a mortgage and a kid on the way.

I shook his hand and said I understood. And I do. I genuinely do. But the second he left my office I wanted to throw something. Not at him. At the wall, at the situation, at the fact that I am apparently the kind of person people eventually need a break from.

Anouk came in later and asked if I was okay. I said fine. She did not push it. I spent the rest of the day reorganizing the supplier spreadsheet, which did not need reorganizing, because I needed my hands to be doing something that did not require thinking about what happens next.

Katrien would say this is the cost. My mother would say this is the cost. Pieter leaving is just the latest version of someone choosing the stable path while I keep chasing whatever is around the next corner. But what is the alternative? Do what Joost does? Same floor, same desk, different title? I would rather fail at something new every two years than succeed at the same thing for twenty.

That sounds brave when I write it. It does not feel brave right now.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry oscillates between defiance and vulnerability, ending with a contradiction
"What does it feel like right now?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Tired, mostly. I will figure it out. I always do. Just need a few days to regroup.
