## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The restructuring announcement came out and my name wasn't on the steering committee. Eleven years. Eleven years and Margareta—who's been here three—gets a seat at the table. I built the Eastern European corridor from nothing. Nothing.

Peter tried to tell me it's just 'optics' and they still value my input. Input. I don't want input, I want the chair I've earned. Spent the whole drive home gripping the wheel. Annika asked what was wrong at dinner and I said work stuff, the usual. Couldn't eat.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry has hedging language ('just optics') and mode is Unsettled

"Does that sit okay?"

### Response

No. It doesn't. And I hate that it bothers me this much because it makes me feel like I'm being petty. But I'm not being petty. I built something and now someone else gets to decide what happens to it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-31

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Halloween candy by the door, Annika's idea, we never get trick-or-treaters anymore because the neighborhood's aged out but she insists. Budget meeting ran long, had to push back on Eriksson's proposal to outsource the warehouse staff. Not because the numbers don't work—they probably do, short-term—but because we've promised those people stability. Some of them have been with us since the nineties. You don't just toss that aside for a quarterly bump.

Came home, opened a beer, watched some documentary about shipping containers. Half-watched. Kept checking email. Nothing important. The restructuring thing is still rattling around but I'm trying not to let it consume me. Made a point to ask Jakob about his university applications at dinner. He wants to study in Copenhagen. Far but not too far, I suppose. Better than when his sister went to Barcelona. That was hard.

Annika mentioned Christmas planning. Her mother wants us to come to Gothenburg. I'd rather host here where I can control the menu and the guest list but she's already half-committed us. Need to talk about that.

*(No nudge for this entry)*

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Board approved Margareta's restructuring plan. My corridor will report to her now. Can't.

### Nudge (Clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry < 15 words and no concrete details

"What happened right before that?"

### Response

Got the email during the morning standup. Had to keep my face neutral in front of my whole team while reading that everything I'd built was being reorganized under someone else. Left early, said I had a dentist appointment.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-15

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Strange week. Margareta asked me to co-lead the transition planning. Not a courtesy ask—she actually wants my input on the Eastern routes because she knows she doesn't have the relationships I've built with the Polish and Czech partners. Spent two hours on a call with her going through the logistics and she took notes. Actual notes.

Doesn't fix everything but it felt like being seen. Like my eleven years meant something tangible that couldn't just be org-charted away. Came home and actually relaxed for the first time in weeks. Annika noticed.

### Nudge (Grounding)
**Trigger**: Mode is Grounded and entry < 50 words is false but applying 40% elaboration chance

"What made that different?"

### Response

She needed me. Not as a formality, not as optics. She actually needed what I know. That's the thing—I don't need the title if the expertise is recognized. Though I'd still prefer the title.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Signed the new contract addendum. Same salary, same benefits, new reporting line. HR made a point of emphasizing the pension terms remain unchanged which—yes, I checked three times before asking. Not proud of that but not sorry either. Twenty-two years until retirement and I need to know the ground won't shift.

Jakob got into Copenhagen. Annika cried. I shook his hand and then hugged him, which felt awkward but right. Booked the Christmas tickets to Gothenburg. Compromise: we host New Year's here instead.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: 40% random chance for elaboration nudge

"And how did that land?"

*(No response)*
