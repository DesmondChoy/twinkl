## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Can't stop thinking about the community center gig falling through. The funding got pulled because some board member thought the imagery was too political. Too political. It was literally just families crossing a bridge. A bridge. I spent three weeks on those sketches and talked to like twelve people about their stories and now it's just gone because someone on a board who probably drives a Tesla and recycles performatively decided my work made them uncomfortable.

And then I came home and ate delivery Thai in a plastic container because I was too tired to cook. Real consistent, Maya.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry contains hedging language ('too political', 'probably', 'just') and mode is Unsettled

"Does that sit okay?"

### Response

No. None of it does. The project getting killed, but also me being pissed about someone else's carbon footprint while I'm literally generating trash because I'm sad. I don't know how to hold both things.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-04

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Finished the sketch commission for the coffee shop downtown. Paid okay. Owner seems nice, sources beans from some co-op in Guatemala.

### Nudge (Clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry is under 15 words... actually it's 21 words but lacks concrete emotional details

"What pulled you toward that job?"

*(No response)*

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got into it with Dad again. He keeps sending me job listings for graphic design positions at tech companies like I haven't explained a thousand times why I won't do that. He says I'm being naive, that I can't save the world by painting walls, that I'm going to be broke forever. And maybe he's right about the broke part but I don't know how to explain that working for some company optimizing ad clicks would make me feel like I'm dying slowly from the inside.

He brought up the health insurance thing again. Valid point. I have no response to that one. I'm 29 and I literally just hope I don't get sick. That's my healthcare plan. Hope.

The worst part is I can tell he's scared for me. It's not just disappointment, it's fear. And I can't fix that for him. I can't make him understand that there's something in me that won't let me just take the safe path when I know what's happening out there. The Amazon is on fire again. There are kids in cages. And I'm supposed to go design banner ads?

But also I couldn't pay rent last month without borrowing from Sarah. So.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry contains hedging language ('maybe', 'I guess' implied, 'So.') and mode is Unsettled

"What would make it feel less stuck?"

### Response

I genuinely don't know. If I take a corporate job I betray myself. If I don't I betray my dad's trust and probably end up homeless eventually. Maybe there's a middle thing but every middle thing I can think of feels like slow compromise that leads to the same place anyway.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-20

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Weird good day. The refugee resettlement org called back about the mural project I pitched months ago. They want to move forward. Small budget but they're letting me interview the families and incorporate their actual stories. One of the coordinators, Amara, showed me photos her grandmother brought over from Eritrea and I just sat there in her little office crying like an idiot.

Walked home the long way through Laurelhurst Park. Leaves everywhere. Some kid was feeding ducks with her mom and for like ten minutes I didn't feel the weight of everything.

### Nudge (Grounding)
**Trigger**: Mode is Grounded and entry is under 50 words... actually 99 words, checking elaboration - 40% chance

"What made the park moment land different?"

### Response

I think because nothing was being asked of me. I wasn't trying to fix anything or prove anything. Just existing near some ducks and a stranger's kid. My brain went quiet for a bit.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-29

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Spent all day at the climate march. My feet hurt and I lost my voice yelling. Ran into three people from college I hadn't seen in years. Everyone looked tired but there was something nice about being tired together.

*(No nudge for this entry)*
