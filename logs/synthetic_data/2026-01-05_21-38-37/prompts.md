## Common Prompt Components

### Journal Entry Instructions (used in all prompts)
```
## JOURNAL ENTRY INSTRUCTIONS

Generate 5 entries with dates spaced 5-10 days apart starting from 2025-10-25

For each entry, randomly assign:
- Tone: one of [Self-reflective, Brief and factual, Emotional/Venting, Stream of consciousness, Exhausted, Defensive]
- Verbosity: one of [Short (1-3 sentences), Medium (1-2 paragraphs), Long (Detailed reflection)]
- Reflection mode: one of [Unsettled, Grounded, Neutral]

Entry content rules:
- Write like a real personal journal: plain, candid, sometimes messy
- Do NOT open with time of day, weather, or "Today I..." summaries
- Jump into a thought mid-stream
- Avoid "therapy speak"
- For Unsettled mode: describe a choice that sits wrong without analyzing why
- For Grounded mode: describe a small moment where things felt right
- For Neutral mode: routine day, mundane observations
```

### Nudge Decision Rules (used in all prompts)
```
## NUDGE RULES

Apply these rules to decide if an entry gets a nudge:
1. If entry < 15 words and no concrete details → nudge with "clarification"
2. If entry has hedging language ("sort of", "I guess", "maybe", "fine") AND mode is Unsettled → nudge with "tension_surfacing"
3. If mode is Grounded AND entry < 50 words → nudge with "grounding"
4. Otherwise, 40% chance of "elaboration" nudge

Nudge text must be 2-12 words, casual, like natural curiosity. Examples:
- clarification: "What happened right before that?"
- elaboration: "And how did that land?"
- tension_surfacing: "Does that sit okay?"
- grounding: "What made it good?"

BANNED nudge phrases: "I'm sensing", "It sounds like", "I notice", "Have you considered", "Tell me more about", "I'm curious"
```

### Response Generation Rules (used in all prompts)
```
## RESPONSE RULES

70% of nudges get a response. Response styles (pick randomly):
- "Answering directly" (50%): Clear response, 15-60 words
- "Deflecting/redirecting" (30%): Brief acknowledgment, 5-30 words
- "Revealing deeper thought" (20%): More honest than original entry, 20-80 words

If no nudge or no response, set those fields to null.
```
