## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My advisor wants me to commit to the syntactic parsing direction and I said yes in the meeting but walking back to my apartment I kept thinking about that conversation with the visiting researcher about multimodal stuff. The parsing thing is solid, publishable, she said. But I've been reading those papers for six months already and I know exactly how the next two years will go. Committee meetings, incremental experiments, writing the same literature review everyone writes.

There's this food festival happening this weekend that I already bought tickets for, and honestly I'm more interested in that than figuring out my research trajectory. Which probably says something. Amma would say I'm being frivolous again.

"What does frivolous mean to her?"

### Response

She thinks anything that doesn't build toward something concrete is a waste. Like enjoying things is fine but only after you've earned it. I don't know if I believe that but I also can't fully shake it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I sort of blew up at Meera today which I feel terrible about. She was going on about how she's so stressed about quals and I just snapped and said at least you know what you're working toward. Which was mean and also not even about her really. She looked hurt and I apologized but the damage was done I think.

The thing is I've been pretending to be fine with the parsing direction but every time I sit down to code I end up on YouTube or planning trips I can't afford. Last week I looked up one-way flights to Lisbon. For no reason. I'm not going to Lisbon. But the idea of being somewhere completely different where nobody knows my research timeline felt like I could breathe again.

Maybe I'm just not cut out for this. Everyone else seems to tolerate the grind because they see the finish line. I just see years of the same desk, same building, same weekly meetings. Meera has her quals stress but at least she's moving. I feel like I'm on a treadmill someone bolted to the floor.

"Does that sit okay?"

### Response

No. But I don't know what the alternative is. Quitting feels dramatic and staying feels like slow suffocation. I keep hoping something will change but nothing changes unless I change it and I'm too scared to.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Good day. Found a new ramen place with Vikram, walked around the marina after.

### Nudge (Grounding)
**Trigger**: Grounded mode with entry < 50 words

"What made it good?"

### Response

No agenda. We just wandered and talked about nothing important. The ramen was spicy enough to make my nose run and Vikram made fun of me for it. Simple stuff.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-19

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Had my weekly meeting with Dr. Chen. She asked about progress and I gave the usual update—ran some baseline experiments, started annotating the new dataset. She seemed satisfied. I wasn't lying exactly but I also wasn't telling her that I did most of it in a three-hour panic yesterday after spending the week watching cooking videos and reorganizing my apartment.

There's a departmental mixer on Friday. Free wine and those little appetizers that never fill you up. I'll probably go just to break up the week. Raj said he's bringing a friend who works at a startup doing something with language models. Could be interesting or could be another tech bro who thinks academia is quaint.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-28

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Thanksgiving at my cousin's was fine I guess. Same questions about when I'm finishing, same comparisons to Ankit who's already making six figures at Google. I smiled through it and ate too much biryani and came home and slept for eleven hours.

Maybe I should just take the industry job if one comes. The PhD felt like an adventure when I started but now it's just this thing I'm supposed to finish. I keep thinking about that summer I backpacked through Vietnam before grad school. Everything was uncertain and I had no plan and I was happy. Now I have a plan and I'm not.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Hedging language ('fine I guess', 'maybe') with Unsettled mode

"What would leaving actually cost?"

*(No response)*
