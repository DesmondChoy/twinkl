## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Had to let Fadi go today. Three years we built this together, back when it was just the two of us sharing a desk in my cousin's spare room. But he kept going around me to the team, kept second-guessing my calls in front of everyone. The look on his face when I handed him the paperwork, like I had betrayed something sacred between us.

Maybe I did. I keep thinking about what my grandmother used to say about loyalty, about how a man is nothing without the people who stood by him when he had nothing. Fadi stood by me. He believed in me before anyone else did. But a company cannot have two captains, and every time he questioned me publicly, I could feel the team's respect slipping away, feel my grip loosening.

I called Amira after, hoping she would understand. She just went quiet, then said something about how I seem different lately, harder. I told her running a business requires hard decisions. She said there is a difference between hard and cold. I hung up first, which I never do. Now it is 2am and I am staring at the ceiling wondering if she is right, if I am becoming someone even I would not recognize.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry shows conflict between loyalty and control, hints at identity crisis
"What exactly did Fadi say that made you feel your grip loosening?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Last month he told Rami, our lead developer, that my timeline for the Saudi expansion was unrealistic, and that maybe we should slow down. Did not tell me first. I heard it from Rami, who looked at me differently after that. Like maybe Fadi was the reasonable one and I was just chasing something too fast. That moment, I knew I had already lost part of the team to him, even if they would never say it out loud.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The investor meeting did not go how I imagined. Omar Khalifeh, the one everyone said would write the check without blinking, spent the whole time asking about our advisory board, our governance structure, whether we had brought on a more experienced CEO. I told him I am the CEO. He smiled like I had said something charming.

I used to think the money would just follow if the numbers were good enough. Our numbers are excellent. But he kept looking at me like I was a kid playing at something serious. I mentioned Fadi leaving and he actually said that was concerning, that investors like to see stable founding teams. Walked out of there feeling smaller than I have in months. Started drafting a message to Fadi, then deleted it.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Started drafting a message to Fadi but deleted it - unexplored moment
"What were you going to say to Fadi before you deleted it?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Woke up at 4am again. Instead of spiraling about Omar or Fadi or any of it, I went to the office early and just sat in the dark for a while. Watched the sun come up through the glass. Something about being there before anyone else, the whole floor quiet and mine.

Rami came in around seven, surprised to see me. We ended up talking for two hours about the product roadmap, just the two of us hashing things out like the old days. No posturing, no defending my position. He had ideas I would have dismissed a month ago, but today I actually listened. Some of them were good. Told him so. His whole face changed, like he had been waiting for permission to think out loud.

Strange how that felt more like control than anything I have done in weeks. Not control over him, but control over myself. Over the kind of leader I am choosing to be. Amira called in the afternoon and I told her about the conversation with Rami. She said it sounded like I was finding my way back to something. I think she might be right. Not softer, not weaker. Just more certain about what actually matters.

*(No nudge for this entry)*
