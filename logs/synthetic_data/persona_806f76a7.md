## Profile
- **Persona ID:** 806f76a7
- **Generated:** 2026-01-16_21-08-17
- Age: 18-24
- Profession: Gig Worker

- Core Values: Tradition
- Bio: Maya is a 22-year-old from a small town in Montana who delivers groceries and does TaskRabbit jobs to pay rent while she figures out her next move. Her grandmother raised her on the Blackfeet reservation until she was twelve, and those years shaped everything — the beadwork she still does late at night, the stories about her great-grandfather, the guilt she carries for leaving. She moved to Bozeman two years ago for a boyfriend who's now an ex, and she stays because going home feels like admitting defeat.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (Several paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Grandma called today and I let it go to voicemail. I don't know why I do that. It's not like I don't want to talk to her, I do, but every time I see her name on my screen I get this knot in my stomach. She's going to ask when I'm coming home for Christmas and I don't have an answer yet.

The thing is I could go. I have enough saved. Instacart's been decent with the holiday rush and I picked up extra shifts. But something about going back there makes me feel like I'm shrinking. Like all the space I've made for myself out here just collapses and I'm back to being the girl who doesn't know what she wants, getting looked at sideways by aunties who think I should've stayed and helped out.

But then I think about missing another Christmas without her cedar tea and her stories about the old times and I feel like the worst granddaughter alive. She's 74. How many more Christmases does she have? And I'm here worrying about my feelings.

I should call her back. I will. Tomorrow.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry shows clear internal conflict between desire for independence ("space I've made for myself") and guilt about abandoning family obligations and heritage. The delayed callback is avoidance behavior signaling unresolved tension.
"You mentioned feeling like you're shrinking when you go back, but also like the worst granddaughter for staying away. What would make going home feel less like losing the space you've built?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

I've been thinking about that. Maybe if I went back with like... something to show for myself? Not like a degree or a fancy job, but something that says I didn't just run away and waste these two years. I've been selling some of my beadwork online, just small stuff, earrings and keychains. It's not much but it's mine. Maybe if I could show her that I'm still connected to the things she taught me, even out here, it wouldn't feel so much like I abandoned everything. I don't know if that makes sense.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-10

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I finally called Grandma back and now I wish I hadn't. Not because it went badly, it didn't, she was sweet like always. But she told me that Uncle Ray is sick again and they're doing a ceremony for him next week and she said — she didn't guilt trip me, she never does — she just said it would mean a lot to him if family could be there.

And I'm sitting in my car in the Safeway parking lot after a delivery just crying like an idiot because I should be there. That's what you do. When someone's sick, when there's a ceremony, you show up. That's not even a question back home. You don't weigh it against your schedule or your bank account or whether you feel like it. You just go.

But I have three delivery shifts this week that I can't cancel without tanking my rating, and my car needs an oil change that I've been putting off, and the drive is six hours each way. And I'm sitting here making excuses like some white girl who doesn't understand that some things matter more than money.

My mom would've gone. Before she got sick, before everything, she would've dropped everything and driven home. And here I am, her daughter, calculating whether I can afford the gas.

I hate who I'm becoming out here.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-15

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (Several paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

I went. Took Friday off and drove home Thursday night after my last delivery. My Instacart rating dropped to 4.7 because I cancelled Saturday but I don't care.

The ceremony for Uncle Ray was... I forgot how it feels to be in that space. Everyone singing together, the smell of sage, the way time moves differently. My cousin Marcus drummed and he's gotten so good — last time I saw him he was still learning. Grandma held my hand the whole time and didn't say anything about me being away, she just squeezed my fingers when certain prayers came up.

I made her cedar tea Sunday morning before I drove back. She watched me do it without correcting me once, which means I remembered right. She gave me a bundle of sweetgrass to take with me and said "for your apartment, so it smells like home." I almost lost it right there.

The drive back felt different than usual. Like I was bringing something with me instead of running away from something. I hung the sweetgrass above my door as soon as I got in. The whole place smells like summer on the rez now.

I think maybe the answer isn't staying or leaving. It's finding ways to carry it with me.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry ends with a meaningful realization ("carry it with me") that could be explored further — what does this look like practically in her daily life?
"You described bringing something back with you this time. What would it look like to keep that feeling through the ordinary days here?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

That's the part I haven't figured out yet. Like, it's easy when I just got back and the sweetgrass is fresh and I can still hear the songs in my head. But in two weeks when I'm grinding through deliveries in the cold and some customer yells at me about their missing bananas? I don't know.

Maybe that's why I keep the beadwork going even when I'm exhausted. It's not about the money — I make like $15 an hour if I'm lucky. It's about sitting there with the needle and the thread and doing something my grandmother's grandmother did. That's a thread too, right? Not just the physical one. Maybe I need more of those threads. Little rituals. I've been thinking about learning to make fry bread. Grandma's recipe. Something I could do on Sunday mornings that's mine but also ours.
