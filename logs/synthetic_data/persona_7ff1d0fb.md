## Entry 1 - 2025-11-26

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My aunt called again about the civil service exam. She does this every Chuseok season, like clockwork — finds some cousin's daughter who just passed and drops it into conversation as though I asked. I said the same thing I always say. I'm fine. The studio is fine. Rent is covered.

She doesn't believe me. I know because she paused the way she does when she's holding something back, and then she said Umma worries. Which is just her way of saying she worries, but putting it on my mother so it lands harder. I didn't take the bait. Told her I had to go check the kiln.

There was nothing in the kiln. I just sat in the studio and threw a slab that I didn't need. The wheel was cold and the clay was too wet because I hadn't wedged it properly. It didn't matter. I wasn't making anything. I was just moving my hands so I wouldn't think about the conversation. Normal Wednesday.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-30

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (25-80 words, 1 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Gallery owner asked if I'd consider doing a collaboration with a streetwear brand. Custom glaze finishes on sneaker displays. Good money. I said I'd think about it but the whole walk home I kept hearing halmeoni's voice — that clay remembers what your hands were thinking when you shaped it. Felt cheap even considering it.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (160-260 words, 3 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Woke up to a message from Ji-hye. She got into the residency in Arita. The one we both applied to, the one that would have meant three months studying under a fifth-generation potter and learning noborigama firing. She got it and I didn't, and she told me by text at 7am like it was news about the weather.

I know I should feel happy for her. She's my closest friend in the studio and she works harder than anyone I know. But all I can think about is how I spent two weeks on that application, reworking my portfolio statement, asking my old professor for a letter, calling my mother to say I might be in Japan for the spring so don't plan the family trip yet. All of that for a standard rejection email.

The worst part is I can't even be angry about it openly. Ji-hye keeps texting me details — the studio setup, the housing, the firing schedule — and I keep sending congratulations emojis and exclamation marks. My face hurts from performing enthusiasm on a screen. I closed the chat and went back to bed. It's not even noon.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry focuses on the external rejection but doesn't surface what the residency actually meant
"What were you hoping would be different after Arita?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

That I'd come back with something my family could point to. Studying under a master in Japan — that's something even my aunt would understand. It would have bought me time.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Went to the studio after moping around all morning. Didn't want to, but the pieces for the January show won't fire themselves. Started trimming the set of moon jars I threw last week. The proportions on the third one are actually close to what I've been chasing — that slight asymmetry halmeoni always said separates hand from machine.

Nobody cares about that distinction anymore, probably. The gallery visitors want to know the price and whether it fits on a shelf. But I held the jar up to the window light and the walls were even, the foot was clean, and the curve of the shoulder did exactly what I meant it to do. That matters to me even if it doesn't matter to anyone else.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry ends with defensive framing ("even if it doesn't matter to anyone else") that may conceal pride
"Who taught you to look at the shoulder curve like that?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Still at the studio. Eun-bi came by to pick up her tools and asked about the streetwear thing. I told her I'm not doing it and she looked at me like I'd said I don't like money. She said I should be practical, that these collaborations are how young artists build a name now. I told her I already have a name, it's just small.

She means well. But there's something about turning the craft into content that sits wrong with me. Halmeoni spent forty years in the same workshop selling to the same neighborhood. Nobody filmed her. Nobody asked her to put her glazes on handbags. She just made things that people used, and when she died the funeral was standing room only. That's the kind of career that makes sense to me.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (25-80 words, 1 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

End of the day. Checked my account and the last gallery payment was smaller than expected — they took a higher commission this quarter for "marketing costs." Didn't argue. Just transferred Umma's share and looked at what's left. The emergency cushion is thinner than I'd like going into winter.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions financial worry but quickly moves past it
"How thin is thin?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Two months of rent and studio fees. Maybe two and a half if I skip materials. It's not nothing but it's not enough to stop the math running in my head at 2am.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (90-180 words, 2 para) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Sunday morning, studio's empty, just me and the space heater humming. Loading the kiln for the bisque fire — the moon jars plus a few smaller bowls I made for the lunar new year gifts. Every year I make a set for the family, rice bowls with a celadon glaze my grandmother used to mix by feel. I have her ratios written down in a notebook but I still adjust by eye the way she showed me, adding a pinch more calcium when the humidity is high.

Fired up the kiln, set the cone, sat on the floor with tea. The studio smells like dust and wet earth and something burning off the shelves. Nothing urgent. Nothing broken. The jars are in there doing what they'll do and I can't control it from out here. So I'm just sitting. The heater clicks off and on. That's the whole update.
