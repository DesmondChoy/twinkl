He has a wife and two young children. His work sells well through galleries that want pieces matching their clients' decor, and he's become known for delivering exactly what the brief requests. He serves on the board of a local artists' collective, a position that came with recognition in the community. His studio is in Roma Norte, paid for by reliable commissions from architects and interior designers.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-26

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Lost the Grupo Modelo commission to Fernanda. They said they wanted "something bolder" for their new headquarters. I've done six projects for them over the years. My proposal fit their brand guidelines perfectly.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry is very brief and factual without exploring the emotional impact of losing this longstanding client relationship
"What does losing this one mean to you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
It's not about the money, though that hurts too. It's that I thought I knew what they wanted. I've spent years learning to give clients exactly what they ask for, and now that's not enough? Fernanda does these chaotic, aggressive pieces — nothing I would hang in my own home — and suddenly that's what serious companies want. I don't even know how to make work like that anymore. I'm not sure I ever did.

## Entry 2 - 2025-10-28

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My mother called to tell me my cousin Rodrigo just got promoted to partner at his firm. She mentioned it three times during the conversation, which means she was making a point. Rodrigo and I used to be compared constantly growing up — he went the safe route, law school, the path my father would have chosen for me. When my paintings started selling, the comparisons stopped. Now I wonder if they'll start again.

The strange thing is I found myself defending my career to her even though she didn't attack it. I mentioned the board position at the collective, the new studio space, the clients I've worked with. I was listing credentials like she was interviewing me. My father would have been proud of the list. But sitting here after hanging up, I keep thinking about a canvas I stretched three months ago that's still blank in the corner. I bought the paint for it. I had an idea. I just haven't had time between commissions to work on anything that isn't already sold.
