## Entry 1 - 2025-05-11

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Spent all morning fixing the matching algorithm instead of calling back the three tutors who said they might quit. Keep choosing the code over the people. Mom called twice, didn't pick up. The platform won't matter if nobody's left to teach on it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Thinking about yesterday. I tell myself I built this thing to help kids but half the time I'm just hunched over my laptop ignoring everyone. Soyeon asked if I was okay and I said yeah, fine. I wasn't fine. I was annoyed she interrupted me.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry surfaces a gap between stated purpose (helping kids) and actual behavior (isolating, dismissing a friend's concern)
"Who are you building this for right now?"

*(No response - persona did not reply to nudge)*

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

One of the students, Minjun, sent me a message through the app. Just a short thing, maybe three lines. Said his math grade went from a D to a B minus and that his tutor Hyunwoo explains things in a way that doesn't make him feel stupid. I read it on the subway and my eyes got hot. I looked up at the ceiling so nobody would see.

This is why I do it. Not the pitch decks, not the investor meetings I keep fumbling. This kid in Incheon who doesn't feel stupid anymore. I saved the screenshot. I'm going to look at it on the bad days.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry describes a grounding moment but quickly shifts to "bad days" without elaborating
"What do the bad days look like?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Days where nobody replies to my messages. Where I eat convenience store kimbap for dinner again and wonder if I should've just stayed in school like everyone else. Where I check our user numbers and they haven't moved.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-16

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Same day, later. Had dinner with Dad. He drove all the way from Incheon, which means he had something to say. We went to the jjigae place near Hongdae station, the one we used to go to when I was still enrolled and he'd visit on weekends.

He didn't bring up school right away. Asked about the platform, how many students we have now. I told him forty-seven active pairs. He nodded, did the math in his head the way he always does. "That's forty-seven kids whose parents can't afford hagwon," he said. Then he got quiet for a while.

Eventually he said your mother worries. I said I know. He said she doesn't understand why you couldn't do both, school and this. I told him it's not that kind of thing, you can't half-build something like this. He looked at his soup and said I know, I'm just telling you what she says.

We walked to the subway together after. He didn't bring up re-enrolling. That's new. At the turnstile he put his hand on my shoulder for a second, didn't say anything, and went through. I stood there like an idiot watching him go down the escalator. I think that was him saying he gets it. Or at least that he's trying to.

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-22

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My old classmate Eunji posted about getting into Samsung's graduate program. Good for her. Everyone in the group chat congratulating her. I didn't say anything. I'm not jealous, I just don't have anything to say about it. My path looks nothing like that and I'm fine with it.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Hyunwoo, the tutor Minjun likes so much, told me he's graduating next month and can't keep volunteering. He was apologetic about it, kept saying he'd try to find a replacement. I told him it's fine, don't worry about it, we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out is what I say when I have no idea what to do.

I spent the evening going through the waitlist of potential tutors. There are eleven people who signed up in the last month. I messaged all of them. Three bounced, two said they're too busy now, one asked if we pay. Five didn't reply. So that's great.

The thing is I could pay tutors. I have enough from the freelance work to cover maybe two or three stipends. But then I'd have to charge the families or find a sponsor and both of those options make me feel like I'm turning this into something it's not supposed to be. I started this because the whole point was that it's free. That nobody has to qualify or prove they deserve help. But I can't keep bleeding money either. Soyeon says I'm being stubborn about it. She might be right but I don't want to hear it from her right now.

I keep thinking about Minjun. Who's going to explain things to him in a way that doesn't make him feel stupid.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals tension between sustainability and founding principles, ends with concern for a specific student
"What would you tell Minjun if he asked why his tutor left?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

That people move on and it's not his fault. That I'd find someone just as good. I'd be lying about the second part but he doesn't need to carry that. He's fourteen.

## Entry 7 - 2025-05-30

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Haven't slept properly in three days. Freelance deadline tomorrow, two tutor spots still empty, Mom sent a long KakaoTalk message about my cousin's wedding that I know is really about me being twenty-two and having nothing stable. I want to reply to her but I don't know how to explain any of this without starting a fight.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry piles up multiple pressures without addressing any one, particularly the unresolved communication with Mom
"What part of it would start the fight?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

The part where I say I don't regret leaving school. She hears that as me saying her life as a teacher wasn't enough. That's not what I mean but it always lands that way.

## Entry 8 - 2025-06-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Found a replacement tutor for Minjun. Engineering student at Yonsei, seems solid. Stayed up until 2am onboarding her. Soyeon brought me coffee this morning without me asking. I almost cried over a cup of coffee. I think I need to be better at letting people help me.
