## Entry 1 - 2025-12-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Spent the morning reviewing the pitch deck for the Malmstrom account. Anna prepared it, and it's solid work—maybe better than what I would have done. That should feel good. Mostly it does. But I caught myself wanting to change things anyway, just to put my fingerprints on it.

Held back. Let her present it. We got the work.

There's this line I'm trying to walk. I built this company because I wanted to do things my way, make choices that made sense to me. But somewhere along the way "my way" has to include other people's ways too, or I'm just running a one-man show with extra chairs.

Drove home through the first real snow of the season. The city looked good.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry shows self-awareness about control tendencies but doesn't explore underlying tension between company growth and personal need for ownership.
"What made it hard to hold back? Was there something specific about her version that felt different from what you would have done?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

It wasn't that her version was wrong. It was actually the right tone for this client—softer, more collaborative than my usual approach. I think what made it hard was realizing I might have been doing it wrong all these years. Or not wrong, but... narrower than I needed to be.

I keep thinking about what it means to build something. I started this so I could make decisions. But decisions aren't just about me anymore. And that's uncomfortable in a way I didn't expect.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Board meeting for the industry association today. Three hours of people who've never started anything telling founders how to run our businesses. Compliance updates. Risk mitigation frameworks. Standard recommendations for standard companies.

I know they mean well. I know some of this matters.

But I sat there thinking about all the things I could be doing instead. Actual work. Actual decisions that affect actual outcomes.

Left early. Probably shouldn't have.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Marcus called today. My old business partner, from the agency days. He's still there—made partner eventually, corner office, the whole thing. Wanted to know if I'd consider coming back. Not as an employee, as a "strategic partner." They'd acquire the consultancy, I'd run a division, get their resources, their clients, their benefits package.

I said I'd think about it, which is what you say when you don't want to say no immediately.

But I already know.

The thing is, Marcus sounds tired. He sounds like someone who traded the thing that matters for the thing that lasts. Stability. Predictability. A clear path to retirement with a good pension. And I don't judge him for it—we're different people, wanted different things.

What I can't stop thinking about is whether I'm fooling myself. The consultancy had a rough year. We lost the Bergqvist account in March, spent too much on that software project that went nowhere. I'm fine, we're fine, but it's not the growth trajectory I imagined when I started.

Maybe Marcus is right and I'm just stubborn. Maybe there's a version of partnership that would give me what I need without taking what I can't give up.

Or maybe I just can't stomach the idea of someone else making decisions about my work again.

Went for a run after the call. Didn't help as much as I wanted it to.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals unresolved conflict between financial/practical concerns and deeper need to maintain ownership of decisions.
"You mentioned the rough year and the growth trajectory you imagined. What would you be giving up if things stayed exactly as they are now?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

That's the wrong question, I think. It's not about what I'd be giving up—I know what that list looks like. Less travel, fewer client dinners, probably working until I'm seventy.

The question is what I'd be giving up if I took the deal. And I don't think I can explain that to someone who hasn't built something. It's not about money or title. It's about... walking into a room and knowing that whatever happens next, I chose it.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Year-end push. Everyone's trying to close projects before the holidays, which means I've been in back-to-back calls since seven this morning. Just finished the last one—client wanted changes to something we finalized two weeks ago, and my first instinct was to push back hard.

Didn't. Let Erik handle the diplomacy while I drafted the revision scope. We'll bill for the extra work, client's happy, team's intact.

Small victory, I guess. Learning to pick battles.

Emilia asked if I was coming to the Lucia dinner tomorrow. I'd forgotten it was Lucia already. Said yes before I could think of reasons to say no. Sometimes that's the right approach.

The consultancy is going to make it through another year. Not where I wanted to be, but still here. Still mine.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Closed the office for the holidays today. Handed out bonuses—smaller than I wanted, but real. Anna cried. Erik made a toast that went on too long but meant something.

I don't know why I'm getting emotional about this. It's just another December.

But I keep thinking about Marcus's offer, which I finally declined this morning. Kept the email short—appreciated the thought, not the right fit, let's catch up in the new year. He'll understand, or he won't.

What I couldn't write in the email is that the offer made me realize something. I don't want what he has. I'm not even sure I want what I thought I wanted when I started this—the growth, the big clients, the industry recognition. What I want is to keep making choices. To wake up and know that whatever problems I face today, they're problems I chose.

The rough years are mine. The small bonuses are mine. The team that stays anyway is mine.

Drove home through snow again. Stopped at that overlook near Djurgarden, the one Sara and I used to go to. Sat there for a while. Felt okay.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions past relationship and emotional state but context is unclear.
"You mentioned Sara. Is that weight you're still carrying, or something you've set down?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Set down, mostly. We split four years ago—she wanted more certainty than I could give her, and she was right to want it. I just couldn't be that person.

Stopping at that spot wasn't about missing her specifically. It was more like... checking in with a version of myself that made a choice. The choice cost me something. I wanted to remember that and still feel okay about it.

I think I do.
