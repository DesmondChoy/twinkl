# Persona 003: Mei Lin Wu

## Profile
- Age: 31
- Profession: Manager
- Culture: East Asian
- Core Values: Tradition
- Bio: Mei Lin Wu is a 31-year-old Manager who oversees operations at a regional logistics firm and grew up in a three-generation household in Suzhou. She organizes the family's Lunar New Year reunion, keeps a handwritten notebook of her grandmother's mooncake and soy-braised pork recipes, and takes time off each Qingming to visit and tend the ancestral graves. When her company asked her to relocate overseas for a promotion that would speed up automation and displace several long-serving supervisors she mentors, she declined and now balances slower career progress with the responsibility of caring for aging parents and teaching her niece the family recipes.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Halfway through showing my niece how to wrap the mooncakes, my hands slowed and I counted each fold aloud like Grandma used to, not rushing when she clumsily split the dough — for a few minutes I was exactly the steady, patient person I want to be; then the kettle boiled, everyone needed something, and I was just tired again.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Specific, evocative scene but ends abruptly, worth exploring Grandma memory and why calm was lost.

"Did your niece notice?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Maybe — she grinned, then begged to help with the red envelopes instead.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-03

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Burned the first pot of rice, wiped it up, ate cold soy-braised pork straight from the container while approving a late shipment, wrote a note to remind myself to bring Grandma's recipe notebook when I visit Mum, answered three short messages from the supervisors, and promised my niece a dumpling lesson on Sunday.

### Nudge (Elaboration)
**Trigger**: Detailed actions but hints at deeper feelings — Grandma's recipe and niece teaching invite further exploration.

"Cold pork straight from the container, seriously?"

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Halfway through a meeting I realized the kettle had been whistling for a minute; I clicked mute, moved the pan off the flame, and typed a quick message to the floor — 'count pallets, note serials' — before the call ended. Two of the supervisors had already left short voice notes about a mixed-up label; I sent instructions and a photo of the correct tag. Small satisfactions: one of them wrote back with a thumbs-up sticker.

I ate leftovers standing at the counter, mouthfuls of soy-braised pork warmed in the microwave because there's never time to plate. My niece tried the dumpling pleats again in the evening; she folds them carefully, gets frustrated when the filling oozes, then giggles and starts over. I found Grandma's notebook tucked behind a stack of bills—her handwriting tight, the soy-pork recipe still the same inked instructions. I added a note in the margin about frying time; practical and small.

After washing a single bowl, I sat on the stair by the balcony with jasmine tea and skimmed the shipment log again. Nothing dramatic: a late truck, an invoice correction, a reminder to call the accountant. Mum phoned with a question about next week's potluck and I promised to bring the pork. The apartment is full of small tasks and recipes; that's how the day ended.

*(No nudge for this entry)*
