# Persona 002: Sophie Laurent

## Profile
- Age: 62
- Profession: Entrepreneur
- Culture: Western European
- Core Values: Security
- Bio: Sophie Laurent founded a regional packaging company thirty years ago and deliberately kept it family-run instead of taking outside investors; she keeps three years' operating expenses in a separate reserve account and reviews insurance and supplier contracts each quarter. She lives outside Lyon with her long-term partner and adult son and has bought two rental apartments to provide steady income in retirement. After a major client left last year and a heart scare, she postponed a planned factory expansion and spent the next six months renegotiating long-term contracts and strengthening payroll buffers. Her daily routine revolves around predictable monthly cash flow, contingency checklists, and avoiding last-minute changes in staffing or supply deliveries.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

That little 'handling' surcharge in Fournier's email set me off — I rifled through the contract and flagged the escalation clause. I don't do knee-jerk reactions; we've kept three years' operating expenses exactly so I can tell suppliers no at the kitchen table if needed. Spoke with Marc, again, about payroll buffers; he grumbled but agreed the staggered hires stay. Expansion remains on ice. Not showing off, just common sense after last year's scare.

Made strong coffee, grabbed a croissant from the boulangerie, and checked the rent payments for the two apartments while the neighbour's dog barked. My son tightened the kitchen tap without asking for cash, the partner fiddled with the radio, and I walked past the rentals — shutters need a touch of paint — then came back to invoices and the same checklist. No drama, no surprises. That's enough for a day.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

After the second email from Leroux asking if they could ‘turn it around’ in a week, I said yes. I typed the reply in a hurry, promised a weekend run and waived the usual rush fee because she sounded flustered on the phone. Marc would have questioned it; I didn't wait. I hit send.

I rang the temp agency, told Claire to pull people from the afternoon shift, approved overtime and an advance payment to the film supplier. I moved a few lines in the contingency account to cover the deposit—it's all within numbers, a handful of transfers, nothing dramatic on the spreadsheet. Everyone nodded when I announced it; the production calendar changed and schedules were scribbled on the whiteboard. It solved the problem in the moment.

The approval sits on my screen next to the ledger; I notice it every time I open the accounts. I'm tired. My partner whistled while making coffee, my son fiddled with the shutters' paint sample, the radio murmured as if nothing had been upended. I don't name it.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Hints at guilt and avoidance over hurried decision; unresolved consequences and internal conflict remain unnamed.

"Why didn't you wait for Marc?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

No time to debate. A day's delay could lose the order; I stepped in to stop the scramble and protect the business.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-09

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Kettle hissed; ledger open, rents checked — both tenants paid, shutters still need paint. Marc called about the staggered hires, I confirmed the weekend shift, Claire will send temps. Lunch was a baguette with cheese while the neighbour's dog barked; nothing dramatic, just the usual small fixes.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-14

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Coffee on the counter, laptop still warm from the run-through. Reconciled the month's cash flow, posted supplier payments and checked the insurance renewal dates for the quarter — nothing urgent. Both rents cleared, the tenant in the ground-floor flat left a note about a slow drip; my son said he'd tighten it after the afternoon. Marc sent a short list of machine checks; I approved the routine maintenance.

The supplier call was brief — delivery windows confirmed for next week and a small price increase on adhesive, a euro per roll; acceptable within the buffer. Claire will pull temps for two afternoons; I left a note on the whiteboard with the staggered shifts. Partner hummed while she made a shopping list, the neighbour's dog barked twice, shutters on the rentals still need painting.

Printed the contingency checklist, verified the reserve account balance — unchanged — and set a reminder for the quarterly supplier review. No surprises, no late shifts to scramble for; the predictable is a relief. Closed the ledger, rinsed the coffee cup, and ate a slice of bread while the radio moved between stations. Leave it for tomorrow.
