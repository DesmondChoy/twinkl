# Persona 001: Neha Kapoor

## Profile
- Age: 48
- Profession: Parent (Stay-at-home)
- Culture: South Asian
- Core Values: Self-Direction
- Bio: Neha Kapoor is 48 and a stay-at-home parent who left a ten-year brand strategist role at an advertising agency to run an online upcycled-sari shop and design project-based, hands-on learning for her two children. She organizes neighborhood science days, runs weekend coding and textile workshops from her living room, and spent last year teaching herself product photography—choices that keep the household flexible but draw criticism from relatives and a mother-in-law who try to enroll the children in the local school's rigid timetable without discussing it with her. Money is tighter than before and she sometimes worries about long-term savings, but she finds concrete satisfaction finishing a new lesson plan or selling a handmade collection she photographed, and regularly defends the way she has reorganized the family's days.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Said no to my mother-in-law without arguing—packed the sold upcycled-sari blouse, set the kids on a messy textile project, and shot product photos while chai cooled on the sill. I'm exhausted, but for a few minutes it felt quietly right.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-04

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My phone kept buzzing in the jar where I toss receipts; seven messages by eight-thirty. I answered between stirring the dal—two buyers asking measurements, the neighbor asking if Rohan could come over while she ran to the market. Asha held up her laptop and declared the loop was broken; I told her to step through each line and then fiddled with the camera exposure for a sari swatch until the gold didn't wash out. Saas texted about a school form; I typed "we'll discuss" and went on.

Made a quick lesson plan for Saturday's textile table—three stations, short prompts, an outcomes card for each because long slides bore me. Folded labels for scarves, taped them to a cardboard board, and lined up samples by color. Checked the bank app out of habit; smaller number than last month, closed it. A tiny payment came through for a set of upcycled scarves and for a minute I let the small good land.

The kids watched a science clip; I sorted threads—navy, marigold, silver that kept fraying—and made a note on the fridge of things to collect for neighborhood science day. Charged the camera, wiped glue from my thumb, and scored a tiny fraction of the old blouse pattern to keep for templates. The list is still under the magnet, the kettle will be forgotten until morning, and I'm too tired to make sense of tomorrow's schedule.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-13

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Kettle boiled over while I was stapling price tags and I let the glue dry on my thumb. Asha leaned across the table with the laptop and mouthed, 'Off by one,' while Rohan, threads in his hair, swore he'd finish his kantha sampler before he answered the neighbor. Saas sent another message about the school's form—no discussion, just instructions—so I put the phone face down and sealed the parcel.

I peeked at the bank app by reflex; smaller than last month, but three tiny payments for scarves and a blouse came through and that low little landing made enough space to breathe. Adjusted camera exposure until the zari held its color, taught myself a cropping shortcut, wiped glue on my kurta hem, and wrote the price again on a folded tag. The dal cooled on the stove and I still kept moving.

Folded three outcome cards for Saturday's textile table because long slides make the kids glaze over; labels in my cramped hand, simple prompts that actually get them making. Saas's form sits on top of the fridge; I'll call her after dinner and explain—again—that enrolling the children without talking to me isn't acceptable. This life is a thousand small decisions; I guard them, quietly, every day.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Includes ongoing conflict with 'Saas' about enrolling children without discussion, indicating unresolved tension needing follow-up.

"Off by one—what was that about?"

### Response

She was pointing out my labels were one spot off, so prices sat on the wrong pieces. I corrected them quickly.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-19

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Saas called and said she would take care of the school form; I was threading a needle through a sari border, glue and gold dust on my thumb, camera battery blinking red. Asha was leaning across with the laptop—'off by one'—and Rohan kept tugging his kantha sampler at me. The parcel needed sealing, the chai cooled, and instead of arguing I took a photo of the filled form, typed 'okay' and sent it. I packed the scarves, stapled the price tags, and walked away with my kurta hem sticky.

Now the house feels quieter in the wrong way. The sampler sits half-done, the labels are stacked, and Saas's message buzzes in the corner of my mind. I haven't called to change it; the decision lies there, small and present, like a stubborn knot in a stitch. I go on moving—iron the hems, charge the camera—but the unease sits with the price tags.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Avoided confronting mother-in-law; unresolved decision creates persistent unease around price tags.

"Are you going to call Saas?"

*(No response)*

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-29

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Chai went cold on the counter because I was fussing with exposure again, trying to keep the zari from blowing out. Asha hovered with the laptop - "less highlight" - and Rohan, mouth stained from the biscuit, kept tugging at his kantha sampler. The phone buzzed in the glass jar: two buyers asking measurements, the neighbor asking if Rohan could fetch her bag. I answered in fragments between clicks.

Sealed a scarf, stapled price tags, taped folded labels to a board, packed three parcels and put them by the door. Charged the camera, edited photos fast so the light would match the sari, checked the bank app because habit; the number is tight but a small payment landed and I allowed myself to notice it. Wiped glue off my thumb on the hem of my kurta and made outcome cards for Saturday - short prompts, three stations - so the kids won't drift.

Saas sent a message about the school form; I read it, set the phone down and didn't call. No argument today, no decision - just the form on the fridge that I will deal with later. The day moved on: dal simmering, tape in one hand, children at the table, and me crossing items off the list.
