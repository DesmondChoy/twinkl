# Persona 003: Mark Bennett

## Profile
- Age: 48
- Profession: Software Engineer
- Culture: North American
- Core Values: Tradition, Conformity
- Bio: Mark Bennett is a 48-year-old software engineer in Cleveland who has worked at the same mid-size payment-processing company for 18 years and still runs the Sunday database reconciliation script he inherited from his mentor to ensure month-end reports come out the same way each month. He keeps his mother's Thanksgiving recipes in a worn binder, hosts extended family at his parents' house for holidays, and is teaching his teenage daughter to set the table and carve the roast because he fears those rituals will vanish as cousins move across the country. At work he follows the team's coding standards and release checklist without fail and usually keeps objections to himself in meetings, which leaves him frustrated when leadership pushes new workflows that would upend long-standing processes; he wants to pass on the practices he learned and keep both family and team routines steady.

## Entry 1 - 2025-10-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I clicked 'merge' with the final verification unchecked. In the meeting they were impatient, the product folks kept repeating 'ship now' and someone in the corner joked about month-end. I said nothing when they suggested skipping the last reconcile step. I told myself I'd finish the check afterward, that it was a small shortcut to keep the release on time. The commit went live.

I've run the Sunday database reconciliation script my mentor handed me for years; it's the thing I do to make sure the month-end reports line up. I obey the checklist normally; I keep objections to myself in meetings. This time I filed the objection, muttered 'okay,' and left the assert disabled. It felt easier at the time. People left the room relieved. I sat at my desk with the monitor glow and pretended I wasn't thinking about it.

Now my coffee is cold, the worn Thanksgiving binder is open because my daughter wanted to help with table settings, and that small unease is still there. Nothing exploded, nothing overnight, just a quiet wrongness that won't make itself go away. I'm exhausted.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Clear moral conflict and unresolved guilt about skipping safety step; emotional tension remains.

"Why did you leave the final verification unchecked?"

### Response

I avoided the conflict — easier to nod and let it go than be the blocker. Fatigue and wanting the meeting to end won out over doing the boring, necessary work.

## Entry 2 - 2025-11-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Shoulders tight, coffee cold, I re-enabled the assert in the repo, ran the Sunday reconciliation, fixed the off-by-one, and pushed a tiny commit with a note in the channel saying what I changed. Nobody made a fuss; I didn't grandstand—just did the thing my mentor taught me.

### Nudge (Tension Surfacing)
**Trigger**: Expresses restraint and lingering stress; downplays feelings and hints at unresolved interpersonal tension.

"Why were your shoulders tight?"

### Response

Bracing for someone to freak if anything slipped, and the weight of keeping things steady. Habit of fixing quietly instead of arguing—so I carry it on my own.

## Entry 3 - 2025-11-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Mom's binder open on the kitchen counter, my daughter tugging my sleeve and asking me to show her how to carve the roast. I told her 'not tonight, later' because of one more deploy to babysit, and she nodded. That quiet nod has been with me all evening.

## Entry 4 - 2025-11-17

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

My mug had gone cold on the left side of the desk while I skimmed the PRs—tiny comments rolling in, the usual 'LGTM' and a couple of flagged edge cases. Standup was five minutes of 'on schedule' and smiles; I kept the pushback to myself again, not worth the thirty-second back-and-forth this week. Between meetings I kicked off the reconciliation script just to be methodical; it finishes, I glance at the log, stamp it as done, carry on.

Home smelled like onions and something roasting, Mom's recipe binder lay on the counter with a few pages bookmarked in an oily way that means it's been used. My daughter practiced folding napkins more carefully than last time and insisted on setting an extra fork 'just in case'—I showed her how to place it and how to steady the roast while I slice a small test piece. She likes to ask the same question about which knife is safe; I say 'start with the small serrated' and let her try on a roll.

Later I left a short note in the team's channel: nothing out of the ordinary, numbers clean, moving on. Put the binder on its shelf, wiped the counter, checked tomorrow's calendar, and remembered to sign the permission slip for the science fair—small boxes ticked. No fireworks, no big decisions, just the steady little rituals that keep things predictable enough to sleep.

## Entry 5 - 2025-11-19

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

I said 'hold on' when someone skimmed past the reconciliation line like it was optional. Short, flat, I pointed to the check in the repo and where the assert lives. Nobody made a fuss; someone added it to the ticket and we moved on. Didn't make a scene, didn't lecture.

At home my daughter asked for the knife. I set my hand over hers for the first slice, guided the motion, then let her take the next cuts. She steadied the roast, folded a napkin the way Mom taught me. Quiet, ordinary. I showed and stepped back.
