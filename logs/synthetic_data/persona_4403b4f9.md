## Entry 1 - 2025-01-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My brother-in-law made a comment at Sunday dinner about how I must enjoy "having so much free time now" and I've been thinking about it all week. Free time? I coordinate three different after-school activities, manage the household budget down to the krone, and I've been teaching myself upholstery techniques that would take most people years to master. Just because there's no office title attached doesn't mean I'm sitting around watching television.

I know I shouldn't let it get to me. But there's this part of me that keeps wanting to list all the things I've done this month, all the skills I've picked up, all the ways I've improved how our home runs. The furniture business actually got two new orders last week. That's something, isn't it? Sometimes I feel like I'm running faster than I ever did at the firm, just with nobody keeping score anymore.

### Nudge
**Category:** Clarifying Question

It sounds like that comment really stayed with you. What does "keeping score" mean to you now, outside of the traditional work context?

## Entry 2 - 2025-01-30

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Finished the oak sideboard restoration today. Client picked it up and actually teared up a bit when she saw it. Said it had been her grandmother's and she'd been looking for someone to bring it back properly for years. Took about forty hours total across two weeks.

Started sketching plans for a home workshop expansion. The garage layout isn't working anymore, especially with winter keeping me indoors more. Found some modular storage systems from a German supplier that could work. The twins helped me measure the space after school. Emma is surprisingly good at holding a tape measure steady. I'm thinking if I reorganize everything by March, I could take on bigger pieces. Maybe even start documenting the process to teach others eventually.

### Nudge
**Category:** Encouragement/Validation

That's a meaningful project completion. What was most satisfying about the sideboard work - the technical challenge, the client's response, or something else?

### Response
**Mode:** Elaboration

Honestly? The technical part. Matching the original veneer grain pattern took me three tries and about five hours of research into 1920s Danish furniture styles. When I finally got it right, I took photos before and after just for my own records. The client's reaction was nice, genuinely touching even, but I knew it was good work before she saw it. The satisfaction came earlier, when I stepped back and could see I'd actually pulled it off. The workshop expansion isn't just about space. I want to be able to take on restoration challenges I can't even attempt right now with the current setup.
