- Bio: Lucie is a 23-year-old primary school teaching assistant in Lyon, France, currently finishing her certification to become a full teacher. She shares a bright top-floor flat near the Rhone with her university friend Camille, chosen mostly for the wide windows and the bakery downstairs. Outside of school she spends her evenings trying new restaurants with friends or stretched out on the sofa watching cooking shows, and she keeps a running list of weekend day-trip destinations she wants to tick off before the school year gets too heavy.

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (50-150 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Sat on the balcony after dinner with a glass of something cold and the city was doing that thing where the light turns everything golden. I could hear Camille laughing on the phone inside. I nearly didn't come home after school because some of the other trainees were going for drinks, but I wanted this more. Sounds stupid maybe but I picked the right evening. The air smelled like bread from downstairs and my legs were tired in the good way, like I'd actually done something useful today. The kids were chaos as usual but we got through the maths block without anyone crying, which I'm counting as a win. Sometimes the small stuff is enough.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry captures a contented moment but skims past the choice to come home instead of going out with colleagues
"What made you sure about coming home?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Honestly I just knew I'd be sitting in a loud bar pretending to enjoy myself when all I really wanted was quiet. I like those people fine but I already spent all day performing. The balcony doesn't ask anything from me.

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (50-150 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My mentor observed my lesson on Friday and said I need to be "firmer with boundaries." She means discipline. I know she's right, probably. But I let the kids talk during transitions because they're six and they just want to tell each other stuff. She wrote it up as an area for improvement.

The thing that's sitting wrong is I smiled and nodded and said I'd work on it. I didn't push back at all. Didn't even say what I actually think, which is that making them sit in silence for thirty seconds between activities is pointless. I just folded. Walked out of the meeting feeling like I'd agreed to be someone I'm not and now I have to actually do it on Monday.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals tension between persona's instinct about the kids and automatic compliance with mentor's feedback, explicit discomfort with having "folded"
"What stopped you from saying what you think?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

She's the one signing off on my certification. That's the honest answer. I don't want to be difficult. Everyone else in the programme just does what they're told and it works out fine for them. I don't know why I can't just do the same without it gnawing at me afterwards.

Tried the firmer boundaries thing today and it felt horrible. I made them wait in silence before moving to reading and one of the little ones looked up at me like I'd taken something away from him. Which I had. I kept a straight face and got through it and my mentor wasn't even watching.

I don't know who I did it for. Camille asked how my day was and I said fine. Didn't feel like explaining the whole thing because she'd just say I'm overthinking it, which is probably true but doesn't help. Ate leftover pasta standing up in the kitchen and went to bed at nine. Can't tell if I'm tired or just flat.

My mum called tonight and asked how the placement was going. I told her it was going well. She asked if I was eating properly and sleeping enough and I said yes to both even though the second one is debatable. She worries, and I don't want to give her anything to worry about, so I edit.

It's not lying exactly. It's just that if I say "actually I'm struggling with this one aspect of teaching" she'll spiral into whether I've chosen the right career, whether I should come home for a bit, whether Lyon is too far. I've watched her do it with my brother when he mentioned one bad week at his job and suddenly she was looking up flats near their house for him. I can't open that door.

So the call was fine. Pleasant. We talked about her garden and my aunt's birthday and whether I'd be back for it in September. I said probably, which is true. She sounded happy. I sounded happy. Everyone performed their part.

I don't think there's anything wrong with that. People manage their parents. It's normal. I just wish it didn't take so much energy, the constant calibrating of what to share and what to keep back. By the time I hung up I was more tired than before the call started. Made myself a cup of tea and watched something mindless. Fine evening, really. Nothing to complain about.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry frames the editing as normal but the detailed justification and the word "performed" suggest more weight behind it
"Who are you performing for besides your mum?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

That's a bit much. I just meant we keep things light, it's how we've always been. Anyway the point is the call went fine, not everything needs to be a big revelation.

Absolutely shattered. End-of-module assessments for the kids this week and I've been prepping materials every evening. My eyes hurt from the screen. But there was this moment today during the reading assessment where Nour, who's been struggling all term, read a full page out loud without stopping. She looked at me after and I just gave her a thumbs up and she grinned so wide.

That's it. That's the whole thing I'm holding onto tonight. The rest of the day was paperwork and a tense staff meeting about next year's timetable where I sat there saying nothing because the permanent teachers were arguing and I'm still a trainee so I just kept quiet. Which is fine, that's my place right now. I don't have standing to weigh in on scheduling decisions.

But Nour's face. She's been so anxious about reading and she did it. I didn't even do anything special, just followed the programme and gave her time. Sometimes you don't need to reinvent things.

Camille brought home macarons from that place near her office and we ate them on the balcony even though it was too hot. The pistachio ones are unreasonably good. I told her about Nour and she said "see, you're good at this" and I let myself believe it for a minute. Going to sleep well tonight. Body's wrecked but my head is okay.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions sitting silent in the staff meeting and frames it as knowing her place, worth exploring given pattern from Entry 2
"What would you have said at that meeting if you could?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Probably that the Wednesday afternoon slot they're fighting over doesn't matter as much as they think it does. But I'd never actually say that. I barely know the politics and I don't want to step on anyone. It's smarter to just listen for now and figure out how things work before opening my mouth.

## Entry 6 - 2025-08-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Long (100-300 words) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Friday night and I'm sitting here instead of going to the party at Thomas's place. Everyone from the programme is going. Camille went already, she looked great, asked me three times if I was sure. I said I was tired which is true but also I just didn't want to go and I couldn't say that because then it becomes a whole conversation about why not and am I okay and should she stay.

The real reason is last time at Thomas's I had too much wine and said something about our supervisor that wasn't mean exactly but was honest and I could feel the room shift. Mathilde changed the subject really fast. Nobody brought it up again but I've been thinking about it for weeks. The comment wasn't even bad, I just said she gives vague feedback, which she does, but saying it out loud in front of people felt like I'd broken some rule I didn't know existed.

So now I'm on the sofa with leftover macarons and a show about renovating houses in Normandy and I feel weird about it. Not the staying in part, I genuinely like this. But the fact that I'm staying in because of something I said three weeks ago that probably nobody remembers. That's the part that's sitting wrong. I keep replaying it and adjusting — what I should have said, how I should have laughed it off, whether I should have just kept my mouth shut like I usually do. The mouth-shut version of me has fewer problems but she also has fewer macarons and is standing in Thomas's kitchen right now pretending to enjoy bad speakers and warm beer.

## Entry 7 - 2025-08-14

Got my mid-placement review today. "Meets expectations." Not exceeds, just meets. My mentor said I'm reliable, well-prepared, good with the children, but I need to contribute more in team settings and be more assertive in classroom management. The same things again.

I wanted to say: I am good with the children precisely because I'm not assertive in the way you mean. I let them breathe. But I didn't say that. I thanked her for the feedback and said I'd keep working on it. She seemed satisfied. The review goes in my file and that's that.

Afterwards Thomas asked a few of us how it went and everyone said fine. Mathilde got "exceeds" in classroom management and was obviously pleased. I said mine went well too, which it did, technically. Meets expectations is fine. It's literally the standard. I don't know why I'm annoyed about it.

Actually I do. I'm annoyed because I think I'm better than meets expectations but the things I'm good at aren't the things they measure. They don't have a box for "made a scared kid feel safe enough to read out loud." They have a box for "implements behaviour management strategies consistently." I do implement them. I just don't enjoy it and apparently that shows.

Had dinner with Camille and we split a bottle of wine and she told me about some drama at her office and it was exactly what I needed. Not to think about my own stuff for an hour. Good food, good company, clean kitchen afterwards. The week is done.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry repeatedly frames the review as fine while revealing frustration about what is measured versus what persona believes matters
"Is 'meets expectations' actually fine with you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

No. But what am I going to do, argue with the rubric? I know what they want and I know I could give it to them if I tried harder. I just don't want to become that teacher. The one the kids go quiet around. I'd rather meet expectations and keep the classroom feeling like a place they actually want to be.
