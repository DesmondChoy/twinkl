# Persona 002: Maya Chen

## Profile
- Age: 29
- Profession: Artist
- Culture: North American
- Core Values: Conformity, Hedonism
- Bio: Maya Chen runs a small painting studio in Portland and chose a sunlit loft near a weekly farmers' market so she can eat well and take morning walks before starting commissions. She accepts only projects with clear briefs—community murals, portraits for neighbors and small businesses—and spends extra time reworking compositions and wording to avoid upsetting clients or the neighborhood review board; last year a curator asked her to add a controversial element to a funded mural and she agreed to a toned-down version rather than risk public complaints. To keep her weekends free for ceramics classes and short trips she turned down a steady design job that paid more but meant late nights, and now worries that saying no to gallery organizers or collectors could strain the relationships that supply her reliable commissions.

**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I said yes to a collector's last-minute change - a small logo and a brighter palette - because it was easier than arguing and they'd pay upfront, so I spent Saturday at the easel instead of ceramics class. The canvas is wrapped and out the door, and my studio feels lighter and wrong at the same time.

A smear of ultramarine on my thumb I couldn't rub off before the first coffee. Walked to the farmers' market because the loft needs groceries and I like the walk; picked up a sourdough wedge, a small bunch of kale, and a pear that was too ripe but cheap. Sat for ten minutes on the bench listening to the vendor who always complains about the city permitting process — unrelated conversation but familiar, like a background hum. Came back up the stairs with my tote, sun through the skylight, and put kettled water on for tea.

In the studio I photographed two small canvases for the website and then smoothed a stubborn edge on the portrait commission — the client's note about logo placement still nags, so I rewrote the line in the contract to a specific size instead of hedging. Cleaned brushes (three turpentine-soaked rags in the sink, ugh), ordered a new roll of gesso, paid that invoice that's been sitting for a week. Took a call from a neighbor about the building's recycling schedule. Little things.

Made a simple dinner — noodles and those roasted carrots I finally got around to — and watched a documentary while I folded laundry. Still aware of the trade-offs: I said no to a steady job to keep weekends free, and every time I agree to last-minute tweaks I can feel how that boundary softens. Not a crisis, just bookkeeping in my head: ceramics class on the calendar, try not to miss it again.

## Entry 3 - 2023-11-06

**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Phone buzzed—owner of the café on the corner wanted their tiny logo painted into the mural; I typed a short, firm note saying I couldn't alter the composition but offered a painted donor panel or a set of prints instead, hit send, shut the laptop, and rode to the market with my tote and my hands still smelling of linseed.

Linseed on my palms when I ran down to the farmers' market for eggs and a pear; the sourdough vendor had the longer line so I bought a small bunch of kale from the woman with the succulents and listened to the usual city-permit grumble. Back in the loft I tightened a stretcher, cleaned three brushes, replied to the café about a donor panel, boiled noodles.

**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Halfway through rinsing a flat brush I noticed a faint smudge at the portrait's jaw and spent ten minutes feathering it out instead of making the grocery list. The commission is finally banded and boxed — corners taped, fragile sticker crooked — and I keep rewriting that one email about logo placement because phrasing feels like a small permission slip. Printer was out of ink when I tried to print the return label; the building's shared office has a cranky copier, of course.

At the market the sourdough line was long so I grabbed a heel, a tiny bunch of kale from the woman with the chipped enamel bowl, and a pear that was almost too soft. The tomato stall guy grumbled about permits as usual; it's background noise now. Walked home with wet tote strap and the pear warm in my palm, boiled water for tea and let a kettle sing while I sorted brushes.

Photographed a couple of small studies for the website — detail shots, nothing fancy — but didn't post them. Cleaned three brushes, fished turps-soaked rags out of the sink (must remember to throw them out tomorrow), made noodles, folded laundry, half-watching a documentary about architecture because it's easy to keep my hands busy. The little worry about saying no to organizers and collectors hovered but didn't demand action; I left it with the dishes and put ceramics class on the calendar again.
