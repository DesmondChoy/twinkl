## Profile
- Age: 62
- Profession: Entrepreneur
- Culture: South Asian
- Core Values: Tradition, Universalism
- Bio: Asha Patel, 62, returned to her hometown after her father's illness and took over the family handloom workshop, keeping alive Patola weaving techniques and the ritual of preparing her mother's halva for Diwali, which she insists apprentices learn to make for festival sales. She runs a social enterprise selling organic-dyed saris, hires displaced weavers at fair wages, partners with a river-cleanup NGO, and channels part of the profits into scholarships for rural girls. Torn between relatives urging her to mass-produce with cheaper dyes and her drive to protect weavers' livelihoods and the river basin, she measures success by the number of apprentices who can reproduce the ancestral weave and by improvements in local water quality.

**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

When the buyer at the fair leaned in and said, 'Switch to chemical dyes, we'll double the order,' I didn't hem and haw. I said no—plain. He wanted me to cut corners. I told him the real prices: organic vats, fair wages, the small river-cleanup fee we add. He closed his notebook. The apprentices were quiet; one of them kept watching my hands.

It wasn't a spectacle. No speeches. Later I wrapped a sari slowly and made a little pot of Amma's halva to test a new batch for Diwali sales. The nod from that apprentice when she tied the knot—small, stubborn—felt like the Asha I want to be: blunt enough to refuse, steady enough to keep the old patola weave going. I went home tired but no regret.

Said yes before I finished my tea. The boutique called, big order for Diwali, wanted 'fast bright' and the relatives were already tallying profit. I told Maya to mix a small batch of synthetic dye in the back and to follow the new recipe; I stood over the vat more because habit than choice. The colour bloomed too quickly, no slow coaxing, no scent of turmeric or indigo—just that sharp chemical smell that made my throat close.

I washed my hands, watched the rinse water go down the drain and didn't stop it. We wrapped the saris in plastic the buyer asked for. The apprentices laughed about the extra wages and I let the laugh out of me too. Later I made a small pot of Amma's halva, more out of routine than celebration, and the sweetness didn't quite reach the part of me that was registering how different the day felt. It sits there.

Maya reached for the sachet of fast-bright; my hand closed over hers before either of us knew what we were doing. She tried to joke—'they'll sign off fast, more money'—and I put the sachet on the top shelf. No lecture. I went to the indigo vat, dipped a scrap, wrung it slow, coaxed the blue out the way Amma taught me—slow heat, a pinch of soda, patient watching.

An apprentice crouched beside me and copied the thumb-press; her first clumsy strokes turned into something steadier. We wrapped the test piece, left the sachet on the shelf where it belongs, not thrown away but not to be used lightly. Made a small pot of Amma's halva afterward—quiet, not applause, just the sweetness that steadies a hand.

My thumb still knew the pressure for the final knot before my head did. I wrapped three saris—two indigo, one turmeric-copper—tucked receipts into an envelope and moved on. The order list on the table was plain: names, measurements, tiny margins. Rani practiced the diagonal twill while I signed the cheque for the dye supplier; our talk was short, about who would run to the market.

I made Amma's halva in the small pot we use all year—half measure suji, extra ghee because it's nearly Diwali, a pinch of cardamom. The back room quieted while I stirred; I let each apprentice taste a warm spoon before they returned to stretching warp. The halva is routine, a small pause between work and festival.

The indigo vat looked the same, slow and heavy, and the sachet of fast-bright still sits on the top shelf, unused. Papers were signed, wages counted into the steel tin, the river NGO left a note about the cleanup next weekend. Hands blue under my nails, palms warm from the halva pot, I washed up—no fireworks, only the steady chores.

I cut the boutique's call mid-sentence, hung up, and went to the loom where Rani's fingers fumbled the diagonal twill. I steadied her thumbs, showed the knot without a lecture, then made a small pot of Amma's halva and handed her the spoon—quiet, the Asha I want to be.

Hand moved to the indigo vat before my head finished the list; Rani relearned the diagonal knot, Maya bundled saris in the buyer's plastic, the sachet of fast-bright sits on the top shelf like a small accusation, and I stirred a tiny pot of Amma's halva because habit calms hands. I'm bone tired.

**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Wrote my initials on the buyer's amendment to omit the river-cleanup fee so the advance would clear; Maya packed saris into the plastic and Rani kept the loom humming. I stirred Amma's halva, ate a spoon, and the signed paper sits on the table.

The amendment with my initials was still on the table; the ledger open, my palms faintly smelling of indigo. I picked up a pen. Where I'd initialed to drop the river-cleanup fee a week ago I wrote, in small letters, 'Please reinstate river-cleanup fee.' I initialed again, folded the page, slipped it into the envelope and set it in the steel tin with the wages.

Maya came in carrying the wrapped saris; the plastic crinkled. She glanced at the envelope and asked, quietly, 'Will they take it?' I didn't answer. I warmed Amma's halva—half measure suji, extra ghee, a pinch of cardamom—and handed out spoons. Rani kept the loom moving; the indigo vat breathed slow. We ate, palms blue, and went back to work.

No speech, no announcement. Just a small paper changed and a knot shown again until Rani's thumb found the right pressure. That smallness felt right—quiet and stubborn. I went back to the loom, the warp taut under my palms.

When Rajni pushed the school notice across the table I folded it into my palm without looking. Her boy's name in the corner; a due date cruelly close. For weeks I'd been keeping an envelope marked Scholarships—Amma's handwriting, the list of girls. I sat, opened the steel tin where we keep petty cash, and the envelope felt heavier than I expected.

I took the notes out and slid them to her. She pressed her forehead to her hands and said, 'I'll pay back,' like it was medicine. I wrote 'loan' in a corner of the receipt and stapled it to the folder. Maya watched from the doorway; the apprentices' feet kept time with the looms. I made Amma's halva because my hands move that way, handed Rajni a spoon, and couldn't make the sweetness match the money.

I taped a small note on the scholarship folder—'return before Holi'—and put the envelope back where it lives, lighter now. There will be ways to replace this, I suppose, but for tonight the ledger has that blank. The indigo smell at my nails, the NGO's note under the cheque book, the wrapped saris in the corner—there is a small ache. It sits wrong.
