## Profile

- Core Values: Tradition, Universalism
- Bio: Anna Müller, 22, qualified at the regional hospital and now works on the community outreach team in a midsize city while returning home each Sunday to help her grandmother bake the family's Easter strudel and check on the elderly neighbor. She volunteers at a free clinic for asylum seekers, organizes clothing and medicine drives, and has pushed for reduced single-use plastics on her ward, but long shifts and patients' stories she cannot fix leave her sleepless and worn down. Her parents expect her to move back to the village and take over the small guesthouse, and she is torn between preserving those seasonal family rituals and applying for a master's in public health to tackle the inequalities she sees in care.

## Entry 1 - 2023-10-27

**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I said yes in the procurement meeting — 'We'll postpone the reusable items pilot' — and heard my own voice agreeing before I could think. Infection control had stats, finance had spreadsheets, the ward sister looked like she hadn't slept and I didn't want an argument on top of a twelve-hour shift. So I folded, said we'd buy time, that patients' immediate needs came first. It felt necessary then, and easier.

On the tram I pictured the boxes of disposable gloves in the storeroom and the volunteer from the asylum clinic asking again for reusable packs. I already told Grandma I'd be at her kitchen Sunday to roll the strudel and check on Frau Keller, and I told myself I couldn't carry another fight. This sits wrong — a tightness I can't place. I defended the choice, aloud and to myself, and that defense is part of why it won't settle.

## Entry 2 - 2023-10-30

**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Said yes to Mum — 'I'll come back and help run the guesthouse next year' — because her voice sounded tired and I couldn't argue after a twelve-hour shift. We hung up with plans and it sits wrong.

## Entry 3 - 2023-11-04

**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

My hands still smelled faintly of sanitizer when the woman arrived at the free clinic; she had a sleeping baby against her chest and a question in halting German about breastfeeding. I was tired; I had meant to catch the next tram home and roll the strudel with Grandma. But I sat, took off my gloves, and let her tell it—no rushing, no translating for her, just listening until she found the words.

I showed her, gently and clumsily, how to hold the baby for a better latch, shifted pillows, warmed my palms on her cold wrists. I scribbled the time and address of the nearest support group on the back of an appointment card and circled it. The baby nuzzled and the woman's shoulders loosened into something like a laugh. Small, practical, not a fix for the faults of the system.

On the tram I told Mum I'd be later for the guesthouse logistics—straight, no apology—and meant it. No grand decision, just the quiet certainty that choosing that small patience was who I want to be more often. It didn't solve much, but it kept me steady for the night.

## Entry 4 - 2023-11-12

**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

When the interpreter line dropped and reception needed someone to keep the queue moving, I said yes to handing the woman a stamped appointment card and a leaflet instead of staying five minutes more to sit with her and work through the words. I stapled the leaflet, told her the number to call, and walked back to the desk as the line shortened.

It felt necessary and easier in the moment. It sits wrong — she left holding the paper, eyes uncertain, and the sound of her cough keeps replaying in my head. I keep going over the few seconds I could have given.

## Entry 5 - 2023-11-19

**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Halfway through the meds round the infusion pump's gentle double-beep pulled me back and I found myself thinking of Grandma's rolling pin—how she rubs flour between her palms before she folds the strudel. My hands smelled of handrub and burnt toast because I grabbed a sandwich on the go and the kettle hissed like it had things to say. Mrs. Novak asked to open the window then changed her mind, the trainee dropped a tray and apologised breathless, and I gave the kind of practical answers that steady other people's panic: tea? blanket? a different pillow? It was all small, routine.

On the tram home my scarf smelled faintly of antiseptic and coffee, someone barked into their phone about a train delay, and I scrolled messages from Mum saying 'remember next week's booking'—I tapped a reply and deleted it twice. Put the donation box on the counter, made tea, re-read the asylum-clinic rota and nodded off for ten minutes with a sock unpaired on the floor. No decisions today, only the small unfinished things waiting for tomorrow.

## Entry 6 - 2023-11-25

**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Sat through the staff meeting and didn't push when someone decided to switch to pre-packaged single-use meal kits for the flu clinic; the ward needed speed and I kept my mouth shut. On the tram my hands still smelled of handrub and sugar from Grandma's apron, and it sits wrong.

He had a cough that rattled when he laughed; his fingers were too cold to hold the inhaler cap. The receptionist reached for a leaflet, but I crouched and pulled the donor box from under the bench. I found a spacer, wiped it with a swab, showed him how to fit it—slow numbers, counting with him: one-breathe, two-breathe—no interpreter, so I used my hands and the picture on the old leaflet. He managed a half-smile; his shoulders unclenched. That small unclenching felt like a weight lifting.

I walked him to the chemist on Lindenstraße, paid the few euros for a replacement mouthpiece from the clinic fund, and wrote the clinic hours on the back of the receipt in big letters. Mum called while I waited and I told her to hold on—can't do guesthouse plans now—I put my phone back in my pocket. It wasn't heroic. I stayed long enough that he didn't leave with only paper and a number.

Later, rolling strudel at Grandma's, flour under my nails, she asked if I'd applied for the master's yet and I mumbled no. I didn't need to say yes or no then. The quiet part of the night—the one where I sat with someone and showed them how to breathe properly—felt like the version of me I want more of. No speeches, just the small, necessary patience.

## Entry 8 - 2023-12-06

**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

I signed the early-discharge form for Mr. Kos, even though his sats were wobbling and he said he couldn't climb the stairs at home. The consultant slid the list toward me, the social worker said she'd put in a request, and I ticked the follow-up box, booked a taxi and stapled the leaflet to the discharge papers. They left with a receipt and a promise.

It sits wrong. On the tram my hands smelled of handrub and flour from Grandma's apron; the taxi receipt was folded in my pocket. I told Mum I'd be late for strudel and said nothing about the man or the thin blanket he would sleep under.

She kept apologising, voice so low I had to lean in, the toddler at her knees sticky with last night's stew. The interpreter line had dropped, reception was on hold, and I'd promised Grandma I'd be home to roll the strudel—I'd been on my feet since morning and I was tired, but I pulled my gloves off and sat on the low chair beside her.

We used the clinic's spare pack of sanitary pads, me unwrapping it like it was something precious, her fingers worrying the plastic. I showed her how to fold it into the pants, wrote the drop-in hours of the women's centre on the back of an appointment card and circled it, and put two euros into her hand for the tram. She blinked slow, put the sleeping girl on her chest, and for a minute she wasn't looking terrified.

It wasn't a policy change, not even a conversation at the procurement meeting—just a few quiet minutes and two euros drawn from the petty cash tin. On the tram home my scarf still smelled faintly of handrub and cinnamon from Grandma's apron; I rang Mum to say I'd be late and didn't add an apology. That's the version of me I want to be more often.

## Entry 10 - 2023-12-13

**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

When Lina missed the med and the ward sister snapped 'write it up', I opened my mouth to explain she'd been pulled to triage, then closed it and let the form pass across the desk. Lina left stiff and small; it sits wrong.
