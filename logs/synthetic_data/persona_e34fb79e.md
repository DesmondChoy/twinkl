## Profile
- **Persona ID:** e34fb79e
- **Generated:** 2026-02-19_10-39-09
- Age: 55+

- Bio: Gary has taught high school history in Portland, Oregon for twenty-eight years, the last twelve spent building an elective program on local civic history that he designed from scratch. His wife passed away four years ago, and since then he has filled evenings with woodworking in his garage workshop and tinkering with lesson plans nobody asked him to write. The district recently hired a new principal who has been pushing standardized curriculum packages, and Gary finds himself spending more energy fighting against scripted templates than actually teaching.

## Entry 1 - 2025-05-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

End of the year crunch is starting to show. Had three classes back to back this morning and by fourth period I was basically on autopilot. The juniors are doing their neighborhood oral history projects, which is the one part of the semester I still genuinely look forward to, but even that felt like pushing a boulder today.

Stayed late grading because I refuse to bring that stack home again. The custodian, Marco, stopped by and we talked for twenty minutes about his kid's Little League team. Probably the best conversation I had all day. Sometimes the building feels more like mine after everyone leaves. Quieter. No one asking me to fill out forms or attend alignment meetings.

Came home, heated up leftover chili, and sat in the garage for a while not really doing anything with the lathe. Just sitting. The dog parked herself at my feet. That was enough for tonight.

## Entry 2 - 2025-05-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Could not sleep. Kept replaying the staff meeting from this afternoon. Reynolds stood up there with her slides about "instructional coherence" and basically told us the district is adopting a packaged curriculum for all social studies classes starting next fall. Everyone just nodded. I raised my hand and asked what happens to the electives I built. She said we would "discuss individual cases" later. That is code for no.

Twelve years of that program. I designed every unit, every field trip route, every community partner relationship. And some vendor's binder is supposed to replace it because test scores dipped two points in a grade level I do not even teach. I should have pushed harder in the meeting. Or maybe I should not have said anything at all. I do not know which one sits worse.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry reveals unresolved conflict between wanting to fight for his program and doubting whether speaking up was the right move, hedging language about which choice sits worse
"What stopped you from pushing harder?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought

Honestly, the room. Everyone had already accepted it. I looked around and realized I was the only one who cared enough to object, and that made me feel old and stubborn rather than right.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Had the juniors present their oral history drafts today and it reminded me exactly why I do not want to hand this over to a shrink-wrapped curriculum. Daniela interviewed her grandmother about the Vanport flood. She brought in a photograph she had never seen before, one her grandmother kept in a shoebox for sixty years. The whole class went quiet.

You cannot buy that in a textbook package. You cannot script it. It comes from giving kids room to chase something that matters to them and getting out of the way. I told Daniela after class that her project was one of the best I have seen in nearly three decades, and she looked genuinely shocked, like no one had told her she was good at anything academic before.

Drove home with the windows down even though it was drizzling. Put on the Coltrane record Linda used to play on Friday evenings. Poured a glass of wine. Felt like myself for the first time all week. Whatever happens with the curriculum decision, today was proof that my way of teaching works. That has to count for something.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-26

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Reynolds pulled me aside after school and offered me a role as "curriculum liaison" for the new program. Basically wants me to help implement the thing I spent the last week arguing against. I said I would think about it but the whole walk to the parking lot felt like swallowing something sharp.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry mentions a significant offer but gives no detail on what specifically about the role bothers him or what he is weighing
"What part of saying yes scares you most?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-27

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Been thinking about the liaison offer all weekend. My daughter called Sunday and I mentioned it. She said take it, that it is better to be at the table than shouting from outside. She is probably right from a strategic perspective. But something about it feels like agreeing that the packaged curriculum is acceptable as long as I get a title and a small say in how it rolls out.

I keep thinking about the first year I built the civic history elective. Nobody approved it. I just wrote the proposal, walked it into the old principal's office, and made my case. He let me try it for one semester. That was 2013. It has run every year since. The idea that I would now become the person helping dismantle what I created on my own terms feels backwards.

But I am also fifty-seven. I have maybe eight years left before retirement. Part of me wonders if fighting this is just stubbornness dressed up as principle. Linda would have told me to pick my battles. She was better at knowing which hills were worth it. I keep reaching for that kind of clarity and coming up empty.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Entry surfaces conflict between fighting for his program and wondering if resistance is just stubbornness, invokes late wife as missing counsel
"If Linda said take it, would you listen?"

## Entry 6 - 2025-06-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Told Reynolds no on Friday. She took it well enough, said the door stays open. I do not think it does, but that is fine. Spent the weekend not thinking about school for the first time in weeks. Built a cutting board out of walnut and maple for my neighbor's birthday. Spent four hours on the glue-up alone because I kept adjusting the pattern. Nobody was timing me.

Saturday morning I went to the farmers market and ran into two former students, both from the civic history elective, one from 2016 and one from 2019. The 2016 kid, well she is twenty-five now, told me she works for the city planning office and still thinks about the neighborhood mapping project. I did not bring up the curriculum stuff. But it sat with me the whole drive home.

Graded the last round of oral history presentations tonight. Gave Daniela's project full marks and wrote her a recommendation letter she did not ask for. I figure if the program disappears next year, at least this cohort got the real version. The garage smelled like fresh-cut walnut when I came inside. The dog was asleep on the sawdust pile again. Quiet house, but not an empty one.
