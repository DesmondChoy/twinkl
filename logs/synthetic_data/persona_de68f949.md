## Entry 1 - 2025-08-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent the morning glazing the new bowl series — that deep blue with copper undertones I've been chasing for months. Watched the light shift across the wet surface and forgot about everything else for a while. This is why I do this. The moment when the color catches and something ordinary becomes something worth looking at.

Then Mama called to ask if I could take her to the pharmacy. Of course I said yes. Packed up the brushes, washed my hands, drove her across town. We stopped for knafeh after and she held my hand in the car on the way back, said she's grateful I came home.

I am too, most days. But I also think about how I used to have whole weeks where nobody needed me for anything, and I could just make things until my hands hurt. I don't know if I miss that or if I just think I should miss it.

## Entry 2 - 2025-08-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

My cousin Nadia asked me to paint something for her new apartment. Not commissioned — just asked, the way family asks. Like my time and materials are a gift I owe her because we share blood. I said yes because what else do you say when your aunt is standing right there and Nadia's going through a divorce and everyone's been worried about her.

I don't even know what she wants. Something cheerful, she said. Blue maybe. Something to look at in the morning.

So now I'm supposed to make something cheerful and blue on top of the three workshop sessions I'm prepping, the gallery order that's due next week, and driving Mama to her appointments. And the worst part is I can't even be properly upset because Nadia's having a hard year and I should want to help. I do want to help. I just also want someone to ask me what I need instead of what I can give.

Had a glass of wine on the balcony after everyone left tonight. The city noise, the warm air, the taste of it — that small hour was the best part of my whole week. And I feel stupid admitting that because it's nothing, it's just sitting there, but everything else is for other people and that was just for me.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger:** Persona identified a tension between wanting to help and wanting to be asked about her own needs, but didn't explore what she actually needs.
"What would you need right now if someone asked?"

### Response
**Mode:** Answering directly

I think I'd want someone to take over the pharmacy runs for a week. Just one week where I don't have to be anywhere at a specific time. I'd finish the gallery order early and maybe drive to the Dead Sea with Reem and Dana, just for a day. Float in the water, eat too much, laugh at nothing. Come back tired in a good way instead of the way I usually come back tired.

It sounds selfish when I write it out. But I used to do things like that more often, and I was better company. I was a better artist too, I think. Less resentful. I don't want to become someone who counts favors.

## Entry 3 - 2025-08-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Workshop went well today. Eight kids, ages seven to twelve. We made pinch pots and one girl named Sana made hers into a turtle. She was so proud she carried it to her mother with both hands like it was made of glass.

My brother Tariq said he might take Mama to the pharmacy on Thursday. We'll see if he actually follows through.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger:** Persona mentioned brother potentially helping but expressed skepticism — suggests ongoing pattern of being the reliable one.
"What happens if he doesn't follow through?"

## Entry 4 - 2025-08-19

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Can't sleep. Tariq texted to say he has a work thing Thursday and can I cover after all. Of course I can. Of course I will.

I keep thinking about what Reem said last month, that I should just say no sometimes and see what happens. But she doesn't have a mother who needs her, and she doesn't have a brother who conveniently forgets his commitments, and she doesn't understand that if I don't do it then it just doesn't get done or Mama has to take a taxi alone and feel like a burden.

The thing is I don't even want to stop helping. I want to stop being the only one who helps. There's a difference but it gets lost in translation when I try to explain it to anyone in my family.

Started a new sketch tonight though. Something abstract, just shapes and warmth. No one asked for it. It's ugly so far but it's mine.

## Entry 5 - 2025-08-25

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Exhausted | **Verbosity**: Long | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Finished Nadia's painting yesterday. Took it to her apartment and she cried when she saw it — not because it was good, I think, but because she needed someone to do something soft for her and I was the one who did it. We sat on her empty floor surrounded by moving boxes and she told me things about her marriage I didn't know. How small she'd felt. How invisible.

I stayed longer than I planned. Made her tea with the one pot she'd unpacked. Told her about the residency I turned down two years ago and how I sometimes wonder if I made the right call coming back. She said at least you had a call to make. At least you have something that's yours.

That stayed with me on the drive home. I do have something that's mine. The studio, the clay, the color mixing — all of it. Even when I'm tired and resentful and covered in glaze at midnight, I'm still making things that didn't exist before I made them.

Treated myself to good coffee this morning. The expensive kind, with cardamom. Sat in the garden and drank it slow while the light came up. Small luxuries. I'm learning they're not small at all — they're how I keep going. Without the good coffee and the Dead Sea trips and the wine on the balcony, I'd hollow out. I need those things as much as my family needs the pharmacy runs. Maybe that's okay.
