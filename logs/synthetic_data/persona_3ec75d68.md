## Entry 1 - 2025-09-19
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Had the kids do their Chuseok craft projects and half the class glued their hanbok cutouts upside down, which was honestly kind of funny. Spent twenty minutes scraping dried glue off the tables after they left. My co-teacher asked if I wanted to split the cleanup but she had bus duty so I just did it myself. Not a big deal.

Mom called during lunch to confirm Sunday's menu, she's making japchae and wants me to bring the sweet potato starch noodles from that specific shop near my apartment. Already bought them yesterday because I knew she'd ask. She does this every year before the holiday. I don't mind the predictability of it, actually.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mention of already buying noodles before being asked hints at a deeper relationship pattern worth exploring
"You already knew she'd call about the noodles?"

## Entry 2 - 2025-09-21
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Chuseok at my parents' place went fine but my cousin brought up how she's moving to Melbourne for a master's program and everyone kept congratulating her. Sat there smiling but my chest felt tight the whole time.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Entry is brief and vague about what specifically caused the tight-chest feeling
"Tight chest about what exactly?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
I think it's that nobody ever talks about what I'm doing like it's impressive. I've been at the same school for six years, I live close to home, I do what's expected. And that's fine, I chose this. But when everyone lights up about someone leaving, it makes the staying feel small, even though I know it isn't. Or I think I know.

## Entry 3 - 2025-09-25
### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

One of the newer teachers, Miss Shin, asked me at lunch why I didn't apply for the curriculum coordinator position that opened up. She said it like it was obvious I should want it. I told her I'm happy in the classroom, which is true. I like knowing exactly what my day looks like. I know my students, I know the parents, I know which copy machine jams less. There's something to be said for that.

But she kept pushing, saying I'd be "great at leadership" and how it's a step up. A step up from what? I'm not stuck. I chose to stay in this role. The coordinator position means late meetings, district politics, and honestly a barely noticeable pay bump that isn't worth the headache. My contract is stable, my pension is on track, I know what I'm doing here.

I mentioned it to my mom on the phone later and she agreed, said there's no reason to fix what isn't broken. She reminded me that my uncle switched careers three times and now he's borrowing money from grandma. I laughed but it landed differently than she probably intended.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Defends decision firmly but the uncle anecdote "landed differently" suggests internal doubt being suppressed
"Why did the uncle comment land differently?"

### Response
**Mode**: Revealing deeper thought
Because mom used him as a cautionary tale, someone who took risks and failed. And I'm supposed to feel reassured that I'm not him. But part of me wondered if at least he tried something. That's an ugly thought. He's struggling. I don't actually want that. I think I just don't want my only proof that I made the right choice to be someone else's failure.

Checked my savings account this morning before work, just out of habit. The number is fine, it's growing the way it should. Emergency fund fully topped up, separate account for the apartment deposit whenever I decide to actually buy. But standing in the bathroom brushing my teeth and staring at the banking app, I thought, what am I saving toward exactly? A place that looks like my parents' apartment ten minutes away?

One of my students drew a picture of an airplane today and told me she's going to be a pilot. I said that's wonderful. I meant it. But I kept thinking about it through afternoon classes, the certainty she had, like there was no question the world would let her do it.

*(No nudge for this entry)*

**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Spent Saturday morning reorganizing my lesson plan binder for October. Color-coded tabs, printed calendar, all the supplementary worksheets hole-punched and filed. Took almost three hours and I didn't need to do it until next week but it felt good having everything lined up.

Went to my parents' for dinner after. Dad asked if I'd looked into the apartment listings he sent. I said I'd get to it. The listings are all in this neighborhood, which makes sense practically. Close to school, close to them. I bookmarked them. I'll probably go to a few open houses next month, when the semester pace slows down a bit.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions bookmarking apartment listings and "probably" visiting, suggesting passive engagement with a major life decision
"Will you actually go to those open houses?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly
Probably yes. My dad will ask about it and I'll feel guilty if I haven't. And honestly the practical reasons are real, the commute would be easy and I could still do Sunday dinners without driving. It just feels like I'm filling in a template someone else drew.
