- Bio: Ricardo Mendieta is a 48-year-old high school history teacher in Bogotá who built his department from scratch over fifteen years and runs it with an iron schedule and zero tolerance for last-minute curriculum changes from administrators. He sits on three school committees — not because he was asked, but because he inserted himself — and keeps a mental ledger of who owes him professional favors. Outside school he organizes the neighborhood junta de acción comunal, where he chairs meetings with the same firm hand he uses in the classroom.

## Entry 1 - 2025-04-30

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Ran the departmental meeting today and everyone stayed on time, on topic. New teacher Camila tried to bring up a textbook she liked and I redirected before it derailed things. Small thing, but it matters — I set the rhythm of these meetings and when they run well, the whole week runs well.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: The entry focuses on maintaining control of the meeting but the mention of redirecting Camila hints at something worth exploring — whether her input had merit.
"What was Camila's suggestion about?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

Not the point. We had an agenda and I kept us on it.

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Still thinking about that meeting. The truth is Camila looked a little deflated when I moved past her. But if I let every junior teacher pitch their favorite material mid-agenda we would never get through anything. The department works because someone holds the line. That someone is me and it has been me for fifteen years.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Despite the grounded tone, Ricardo is circling back to Camila's reaction unprompted, suggesting her deflation registered more than he wants to admit. The justification feels slightly over-explained.
"She got to you a little, didn't she?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

She is new. She will learn how things work here.

## Entry 3 - 2025-05-01

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Faculty meeting this morning, the big monthly one with the coordinadora and all department heads. I had prepared a ten-minute summary of our curriculum adjustments for next semester. Detailed slides, enrollment data by section, everything organized the way I like — no fluff, just facts and a clear recommendation.

I got three minutes in before the coordinadora cut me off. Said she wanted to "open the floor" for a more collaborative discussion. Then Profesor Ríos from the science department started talking about interdisciplinary projects and somehow my curriculum adjustments became a footnote to his pitch. He used my enrollment data — the numbers I had just shown — to support his own proposal. Nobody seemed to notice. Or maybe they noticed and did not care.

I sat there for the rest of the meeting contributing when asked but mostly just watching my work get absorbed into someone else's narrative. I wanted to say something. That those were my numbers, my analysis, my recommendation. But the coordinadora had already set the tone and pushing back would have looked petty. So I smiled. Nodded. Made a note in my planner to address it privately later.

Walking back to my classroom I could feel it in my jaw, the clenching. Fifteen years I have been building this department and Ríos, who has been here four years, gets to repurpose my work in real time while I sit there like I am attending someone else's meeting.

## Entry 4 - 2025-05-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent the morning reorganizing the exam schedule for finals. Nobody asked me to — I just saw that the current draft from admin had conflicts that would affect my students. Fixed it, sent it to the vice-rector with my corrections marked in red, cc'd the relevant people. That is how you get things done around here. You do not wait for permission, you present the solution.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Ricardo's unsolicited fix and strategic cc suggests a deliberate move to demonstrate competence and influence after yesterday's frustration — worth exploring.
"Why the red marks and the cc's?"

## Entry 5 - 2025-05-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Neutral

Regular Wednesday. Classes went fine. The eleventh graders are reviewing for their exam on Independence movements and most of them actually did the reading, which is a first this semester. Ate lunch at my desk grading quizzes while the other teachers chatted in the sala de profesores.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Choosing to eat alone grading while others socialize may be routine, but the detail feels deliberate — is this preference or avoidance?
"Why at your desk instead of the sala?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

I get more done alone. The sala is just gossip and complaints about students.

## Entry 6 - 2025-05-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Coming back to this because something happened after classes. The vice-rector stopped me in the hallway and thanked me for the exam schedule corrections I sent last week. Said it saved them a headache and that she was going to mention it at the next admin meeting. Small recognition but I will take it. That is how it should work — you do good work, someone notices.

It reminded me of something my father used to say. He managed a textile warehouse in Medellín for twenty-something years and he always told me the man who controls the calendar controls the operation. I did not understand it when I was young. Now I live it. Every week I review the departmental calendar, the exam schedule, the committee meeting dates. I know what is happening before most people know it is happening. That is not obsession, that is just how you keep things from falling apart.

My wife Patricia says I should relax more at home, that I bring the school energy into the house. Maybe she has a point. But when I relax, things slip. I have seen it happen to other department heads. They let go of the reins and within a semester the curriculum is a mess, the exam dates are wrong, and everyone is scrambling. I will not be that person.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Patricia's observation about bringing school energy home combined with Ricardo's rigid insistence that relaxing leads to things "slipping" suggests a fear of losing grip that extends beyond work.
"What would actually slip if you let go?"

Third time writing today but Patricia's comment is still rattling around in my head. She is not wrong that I bring work home. But she married a man who takes charge of things. That is who I am at school and at the junta and at home. I do not know how to be half of that.

## Entry 8 - 2025-05-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Sent the coordinadora an email Monday asking for approval to add a new elective on Colombian political history for next semester. It is Thursday and nothing. No reply, no acknowledgment. I know she read it because she responded to a facilities request I cc'd her on the same day. My proposal just sits there while I wait for someone who probably has not taught a class in a decade to decide whether my idea has merit.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: The frustration about waiting reveals vulnerability — Ricardo's sense of standing depends on his proposals being taken seriously, and the silence feels like dismissal.
"The silence is saying something to you?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

It is saying she does not respect the department heads enough to respond promptly. That is an organizational problem, not a personal one.

## Entry 9 - 2025-05-08

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

The coordinadora finally replied. She likes the elective idea but wants to "co-develop" it with the social sciences department, meaning Profesor Ríos gets to put his fingerprints on my proposal. I wanted to push back but she framed it as collaboration and you cannot argue against that without looking difficult. So I said sounds good. It does not sound good. My idea is about to become a committee project where fifteen years of expertise get diluted into consensus.
