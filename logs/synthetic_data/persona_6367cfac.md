- Bio: Park Jungsoo is a 49-year-old ceramic artist based in Icheon, South Korea, known for its centuries-old pottery heritage. He apprenticed under a master potter for eight years before opening his own kiln, specializing in celadon ware using methods passed down through his teacher's lineage. He lives with his elderly mother in the family home and visits his father's grave every Chuseok and Lunar New Year without fail. His younger sister emigrated to Vancouver a decade ago, a decision he has never fully reconciled with.

## Entry 1 - 2025-12-02

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Fired the second batch of the celadon tea set today and the glaze came out exactly as Master Kwon taught me. Took one piece straight to Mother's room. She held it up to the window light the same way my father used to examine finished work.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Mentions his late father's gesture being repeated by his mother, brief but emotionally loaded moment worth exploring
"What went through you when she did that?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

It was just a nice moment. Anyway, the rest of the batch needs trimming before Thursday.

## Entry 2 - 2025-12-05

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Got an email from the Gyeonggi Cultural Foundation. They want to feature my work in a contemporary ceramics exhibition in Seoul next March. The catch is they want me to collaborate with a digital artist who projects animations onto pottery surfaces.

I said I would review the proposal. The money is good and the exposure would help, but the whole concept feels like it turns the pieces into screens. I keep rereading the email instead of answering it.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona hesitates over a collaboration that conflicts with his craft approach, rereading instead of responding signals internal conflict
"What would Master Kwon say about it?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

He would probably say the clay does not need decoration it did not ask for. But he also told me once that celadon survived because potters adapted across dynasties. I do not know which version of his advice applies here.

## Entry 3 - 2025-12-07

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Emotional/Venting | **Verbosity**: Long (Detailed reflection) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Spent Sunday at the Icheon Ceramics Festival committee meeting. They asked me to join the planning board for next year and I said yes immediately. My father served on that board for eleven years and his teacher before him. Sitting in that room felt like slotting into a space that was kept warm for me.

After the meeting a few of the younger potters invited me for soju. They were talking about selling through Instagram and shipping internationally, and I found myself actually listening instead of dismissing it. One of them, Minji, makes moon jars and photographs them beautifully. She said something about honoring the form while finding new eyes for it, which I have been turning over since.

It is strange how the committee meeting and the conversation afterward both felt right, even though they pull in different directions. The board is about preserving what we have. Minji's approach is about carrying it somewhere else. I suppose someone has to do both.

## Entry 4 - 2025-12-12

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Called my sister Eunji in Vancouver for her birthday. She asked if I would visit in the spring. I told her I would think about it, same thing I say every year.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Repeated deferral on visiting sister acknowledged matter-of-factly, but the pattern itself is worth gentle attention
"What keeps the answer the same each year?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

Someone needs to be here for Mother. And honestly, seeing Eunji's life there, her kids barely speaking Korean, the way she has just folded into something else entirely. It is easier to love her from here.

## Entry 5 - 2025-12-18

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Defensive | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

A gallery owner from Gangnam visited today and suggested I could triple my prices if I made the pieces more "accessible." Smaller, simpler, pastel glazes. I smiled and showed him the door. My kiln is not a factory floor.

### Nudge (elaboration)
**Trigger**: Strong reaction to commercial pressure, but the defensive tone may mask something beneath the certainty
"Did any part of his pitch land, even slightly?"

### Response
**Mode**: Answering directly

The part about reaching more people, maybe. But not at the cost of making things I would be embarrassed to put my name on. There is a difference between sharing what you do and diluting it until it is unrecognizable.

## Entry 6 - 2025-12-21

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Brief and factual | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Mother mentioned at dinner that Eunji wants to hold a small Christmas gathering this year. She asked why we never do that here. I did not know what to say. We do Seollal and Chuseok. That has always been enough.

## Entry 7 - 2025-12-23

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Stream of consciousness | **Verbosity**: Medium (1-2 paragraphs) | **Reflection Mode**: Grounded

Preparing the clay for the new year's first firing, which I always do in the last week of December. Same schedule my teacher kept, same schedule his teacher kept. There is something about the rhythm of it, wedging clay while the house smells like Mother's kimchi jjigae, the mountain visible through the workshop window still holding a little snow.

Minji sent me a photo of one of her moon jars displayed in a café in Itaewon. It looked beautiful, actually, warm light on white clay. I saved the photo. I would not do what she does but I am glad someone is doing it. The work keeps moving even if I stay in one place, and I think that is fine.

### Nudge (clarification)
**Trigger**: Persona explicitly says staying in one place is "fine" while saving the photo of work going elsewhere, subtle tension between contentment and curiosity
"What made you save that photo?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

It was a good photograph. The lighting was well done. Anyway, I need to finish wedging before it gets too cold in the workshop tonight.

## Entry 8 - 2025-12-26

### Initial Entry
**Tone**: Self-reflective | **Verbosity**: Short (1-3 sentences) | **Reflection Mode**: Unsettled

Eunji sent photos of her kids opening presents. My nephew was wearing a hanbok she had sewn herself. It was slightly wrong, the goreum tied on the left side. I almost texted her about it but stopped myself. At least she is trying.

### Nudge (tension_surfacing)
**Trigger**: Persona catches a cultural detail his sister got wrong, impulse to correct versus impulse to appreciate, reflects unresolved tension about sister's distance from heritage
"What stopped you from sending that text?"

### Response
**Mode**: Deflecting/redirecting

She would have felt bad, and it is Christmas over there. It does not matter. The kids looked happy.
