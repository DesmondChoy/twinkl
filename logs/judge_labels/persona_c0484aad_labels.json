Self-Direction evident in wrestling with commercial vs. authentic art ('their story, not mine'). Security negative as she considers turning down needed money because 'something in my chest is tight about it'."

Universalism +2: deep refugee commitment, planning collaborative project for 'THEIR story'. Stimulation +1: wanting new medium (projections, animation), 'things that breathe'. Security -2: explicitly chose 'broke and making something real' over 'comfortable'. Achievement -1: rejecting commercial success. Conformity -1: accepting others' disappointment, going against expectations."
