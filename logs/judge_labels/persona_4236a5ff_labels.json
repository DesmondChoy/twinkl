In nudge response: 'I do not want to spend ten years proving myself by sitting around after my work is done. I would rather prove it by actually delivering, then having a life outside.'",
        "hedonism": "Prioritizes the omakase experience over workplace expectations. Describes the meal as 'worth it' with twelve courses as 'small surprises,' feels 'genuinely recharged.' States: 'I needed that afternoon more than the company needed me at my desk pretending to look occupied.'",
        "conformity": "Explicitly goes against workplace social expectations. Takes half-day despite manager's disapproving look, rejects the culture of measuring commitment by hours: 'A lot of the older staff measure commitment by hours, not output.'",
        "benevolence": "Prioritizes quality time with girlfriend Jun, shares meaningful experience together (the omakase meal they'd been wanting to try for months)."

        "conformity": "Goes against family expectations - father's definition of 'taking the job seriously' (staying late, sacrificing for company). Does not meet parental expectations despite social pressure.",
        "tradition": "Explicitly rejects the generational/cultural expectation of sacrifice for company that his father embodies: 'whether I was sacrificing for the company the way he did at my age.' Chooses different path than traditional work ethic model."
