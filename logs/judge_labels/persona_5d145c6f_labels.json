Strong Achievement through 12-hour workdays and emphasis on growth metrics (85 employees, three offices). Mild Benevolence misalignment through neglecting mother's call and substituting material gifts for presence. Mild Stimulation alignment through pursuing market expansion. Mild Hedonism misalignment as exhaustion is ignored for networking obligations. Self-Direction shown through overriding team recommendations."
