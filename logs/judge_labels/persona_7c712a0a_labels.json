No concrete action taken, but the entry plus nudge reveals his discomfort with routine. Conformity shows as he continues estimating despite the boredom."

He explicitly swallowed his desire for novelty to be the 'adult.' Security and conformity alignment as he prioritized business stability over personal growth. The 'heavy' feeling shows the internal cost."

His reflection on how decisions became heavy after his father's death provides context but doesn't change the final action. The hesitation shows internal conflict but the outcome is pro-stimulation."

His response reveals he makes himself small to let the team function, comparing himself to his father at the factory. Self-direction strongly suppressed as he surrenders his agency. Achievement shows in fixing the incident competently. Power misaligned as he accepts subordination. Security aligned through avoiding conflict."

Conformity aligned (fitting expectations), security aligned (not taking risks). Stimulation and self-direction suppressed as he retreats from acting on conference insights."

Conformity aligned through managing perceptions. Benevolence shows in his consideration for Jennifer."

Strong stimulation and self-direction alignment: seeking novelty, making his own choice, learning something new. Power and achievement misaligned as he accepts apparent demotion. Security misaligned by embracing uncertainty. Conformity misaligned by doing something unexpected. Elena's pride and support shows benevolence in the relationship. He named his fear aloud."
